"In Python, what are metaclasses and what do we use them for?","Before understanding metaclasses, you need to master classes in Python. And Python has a very peculiar idea of what classes are, borrowed from the Smalltalk language.",
"In Python, what are metaclasses and what do we use them for?",A metaclass is the class of a class. A class defines how an instance of the class (i.e. an object) behaves while a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass.,

"In Python, what are metaclasses and what do we use them for?","Others have explained how metaclasses work and how they fit into the Python type system. Here's an example of what they can be used for. In a testing framework I wrote, I wanted to keep track of the order in which classes were defined, so that I could later instantiate them in this order. I found it easiest to do this using a metaclass.",

I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around PEP 380.,"Let's get one thing out of the way first. The explanation that yield from g is equivalent to for v in g: yield v does not even begin to do justice to what yield from is all about. Because, let's face it, if all yield from does is expand the for loop, then it does not warrant adding yield from to the language and preclude a whole bunch of new features from being implemented in Python 2.x.",

I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around PEP 380.,"Wherever you invoke a generator from within a generator you need a ""pump"" to re-yield the values:  for v in inner_generator: yield v.  As the PEP points out there are subtle complexities to this which most people ignore.  Non-local flow-control like throw() is one example given in the PEP.  The new syntax yield from inner_generator is used wherever you would have written the explicit for loop before.  It's not merely syntactic sugar, though:  It handles all of the corner cases that are ignored by the for loop.  Being ""sugary"" encourages people to use it and thus get the right behaviors.",

"I am trying to understand the advantages of multiprocessing over threading.

The difference is that threads run in the same memory space, while processes have separate memory. This makes it a bit harder to share objects between processes with multiprocessing. Since threads use the same memory, precautions have to be taken or two threads will write to the same memory at the same time. This is what the global interpreter lock is for.",
"I am trying to understand the advantages of multiprocessing over threading. I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?","Threading's job is to enable applications to be responsive. Suppose you have a database connection and you need to respond to user input. Without threading, if the database connection is busy the application will not be able to respond to the user. By splitting off the database connection into a separate thread you can make the application more responsive. Also because both threads are in the same process, they can access the same data structures - good performance, plus a flexible software design.",

In the tensorflow API docs they use a keyword called logits. What is it? A lot of methods are written like:,"The softmax+logits simply means that the function operates on the unscaled output of earlier layers and that the relative scale to understand the units is linear.

To get Dawson-like behaviour you might say something like if abs(a-b) <= eps*max(EPS,abs(a),abs(b)) for some small fixed EPS; this isn't exactly the same as Dawson, but it's similar in spirit.",

If you need to shrink and grow your list time-efficiently and without hassle, they are the way to go.

"I came across the Python with statement for the first time today.  I've been using Python lightly for several months and didn't even know of its existence!  Given its somewhat obscure status, I thought it would be worth asking:","I believe this has already been answered by other users before me, so I only add it for the sake of completeness: the with statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks in so-called context managers. More details can be found in PEP 343. For instance, the open statement is a context manager in itself, which lets you open a file, keep it open as long as the execution is in the context of the with statement where you used it, and close it as soon as you leave the context, no matter whether you have left it because of an exception or during regular control flow. The with statement can thus be used in ways similar to the RAII pattern in C++: some resource is acquired by the with statement and released when you leave the with context.",

When should you use generator expressions and when should you use list comprehensions in Python?,"Iterating over the generator expression or the list comprehension will do the same thing.

I'm thinking about putting the virtualenv for a Django web app I am making inside my git repository for the app. It seems like an easy way to keep deploy's simple and easy. Is there any reason why I shouldn't do this?,"Storing the virtualenv directory inside git will, as you noted, allow you to deploy the whole app by just doing a git clone (plus installing and configuring Apache/mod_wsgi).  One potentially significant issue with this approach is that on Linux the full path gets hard-coded in the venv's activate, django-admin.py, easy_install, and pip scripts.  This means your virtualenv won't entirely work if you want to use a different path, perhaps to run multiple virtual hosts on the same server.

Why is cls sometimes used instead of self as an argument in Python classes?,"Instead of accepting a self parameter, class methods take a cls parameter that points to the class—and not the object instance—when
  the method is called.
  Since the class method only has access to this cls argument, it can’t
  modify object instance state. That would require access to self . However, class methods can still modify class state that applies across all
  instances of the class.",

Explicitly pass header=0 to be able to replace existing names. The header can be a list of integers that specify row locations for a multi-index on the columns e.g. [0,1,3]. Intervening rows that are not specified will be skipped (e.g. 2 in this example is skipped).

I want to create an empty array (or matrix) and then add one column (or row) to it at a time.,"A NumPy array is a very different data structure from a list and is designed to be used in different ways.  Your use of hstack is potentially very inefficient... every time you call it, all the data in the existing array is copied into a new one. (The append function will have the same issue.)

Is there a way to open a file for both reading and writing?,"Here's how you read a file, and then write to it (overwriting any existing data), without closing and reopening:",
Is there a way to open a file for both reading and writing?,Summarize the I/O behaviors,
Is there a way to open a file for both reading and writing?,r+ is the canonical mode for reading and writing at the same time. This is not different from using the fopen() system call since file() / open() is just a tiny wrapper around this operating system call.,
Is there a way to open a file for both reading and writing?,I have tried something like this and it works as expected:,
What do I have to do in Python to figure out which encoding a string has?,"In Python 3, all strings are sequences of Unicode characters. There is a bytes type that holds raw bytes.",
What do I have to do in Python to figure out which encoding a string has?,You can use type or isinstance.,
What do I have to do in Python to figure out which encoding a string has?,In python 3.x all strings are sequences of Unicode characters. and doing the isinstance check for str (which means unicode string by default) should suffice.,
What do I have to do in Python to figure out which encoding a string has?,Unicode is not an encoding - to quote Kumar McMillan:,
What do I have to do in Python to figure out which encoding a string has?,"If your code needs to be compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, you can't directly use things like isinstance(s,bytes) or isinstance(s,unicode) without wrapping them in either try/except or a python version test, because bytes is undefined in Python 2 and unicode is undefined in Python 3.",
