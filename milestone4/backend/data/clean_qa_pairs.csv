0,What is the use of the yield keyword in Python? What does it do?,"To understand what yield does, you must understand what generators are. And before you can understand generators, you must understand iterables.",
5,"Given the following code, what does the if __name__ == ""__main__"": do?",It's boilerplate code that protects users from accidentally invoking the script when they didn't intend to. Here are some common problems when the guard is omitted from a script:,
9,"Given the following code, what does the if __name__ == ""__main__"": do?","if __name__ == ""__main__"" is the part that runs when the script is run from (say) the command line using a command like python myscript.py.",
15,"In Python, what are metaclasses and what do we use them for?","Before understanding metaclasses, you need to master classes in Python. And Python has a very peculiar idea of what classes are, borrowed from the Smalltalk language.",
16,"In Python, what are metaclasses and what do we use them for?",A metaclass is the class of a class. A class defines how an instance of the class (i.e. an object) behaves while a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass.,
18,"In Python, what are metaclasses and what do we use them for?","Others have explained how metaclasses work and how they fit into the Python type system. Here's an example of what they can be used for. In a testing framework I wrote, I wanted to keep track of the order in which classes were defined, so that I could later instantiate them in this order. I found it easiest to do this using a metaclass.",
24,"I have two Python dictionaries, and I want to write a single expression that returns these two dictionaries, merged (i.e. taking the union).  The update() method would be what I need, if it returned its result instead of modifying a dictionary in-place.","This probably won't be a popular answer, but you almost certainly do not want to do this.  If you want a copy that's a merge, then use copy (or deepcopy, depending on what you want) and then update.  The two lines of code are much more readable - more Pythonic - than the single line creation with .items() + .items().  Explicit is better than implicit.",
29,How do you call an external command (as if I'd typed it at the Unix shell or Windows command prompt) from within a Python script?,"Note that this is dangerous, since the command isn't cleaned. I leave it up to you to google for the relevant documentation on the 'os' and 'sys' modules. There are a bunch of functions (exec* and spawn*) that will do similar things.",
31,"What is the most elegant way to check if the directory a file is going to be written to exists, and if not, create the directory using Python? Here is what I tried:","pathlib.Path.mkdir as used above recursively creates the directory and does not raise an exception if the directory already exists. If you don't need or want the parents to be created, skip the parents argument.",
36,What is the difference between a function decorated with @staticmethod and one decorated with @classmethod?,"A staticmethod is a method that knows nothing about the class or instance it was called on. It just gets the arguments that were passed, no implicit first argument. It is basically useless in Python -- you can just use a module function instead of a staticmethod.",
37,What is the difference between a function decorated with @staticmethod and one decorated with @classmethod?,"Basically @classmethod makes a method whose first argument is the class it's called from (rather than the class instance), @staticmethod does not have any implicit arguments.",
39,What is the difference between a function decorated with @staticmethod and one decorated with @classmethod?,"To decide whether to use @staticmethod or @classmethod you have to look inside your method. If your method accesses other variables/methods in your class then use @classmethod. On the other hand, if your method does not touches any other parts of the class then use @staticmethod.",
43,I need a good explanation (references are a plus) on Python's slice notation. ,"The answers above don't discuss slice assignment. To understand slice assignment, it's helpful to add another concept to the ASCII art:",
44,I need a good explanation (references are a plus) on Python's slice notation. ,"In short, the colons (:) in subscript notation (subscriptable[subscriptarg]) make slice notation - which has the optional arguments, start, stop, step:",
46,I am a bit puzzled by the following code:,"It's not that key is a special word, but that dictionaries implement the iterator protocol.  You could do this in your class, e.g. see this question for how to build class iterators.",
49,I am a bit puzzled by the following code:,"When you iterate through dictionaries using the for .. in ..-syntax, it always iterates over the keys (the values are accessible using dictionary[key]).",
50,How can I create or use a global variable in a function?,You can use a global variable within other functions by declaring it as global within each function that assigns a value to it:,
51,How can I create or use a global variable in a function?,"If I'm understanding your situation correctly, what you're seeing is the result of how Python handles local (function) and global (module) namespaces.",
53,How can I create or use a global variable in a function?,"Python uses a simple heuristic to decide which scope it should load a variable from, between local and global.  If a variable name appears on the left hand side of an assignment, but is not declared global, it is assumed to be local.  If it does not appear on the left hand side of an assignment, it is assumed to be global.  ",
54,How can I create or use a global variable in a function?,"If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global. You don't have to use it in all cases (as someone here incorrectly claims) - if the name referenced in an expression cannot be found in local scope or scopes in the functions in which this function is defined, it is looked up among global variables.",
58,I'm looking for a string.contains or string.indexof method in Python.,"if needle in haystack: is the normal use, as @Michael says -- it relies on the in operator, more readable and faster than a method call.",
63,I know that I can do:,"If you frequently use a large number of exceptions, you can pre-define a tuple, so you don't have to re-type them many times. ",
72,How do I concatenate two lists in Python?,It's also possible to create a generator that simply iterates over the items in both lists using itertools.chain(). This allows you to chain lists (or any iterable) together for processing without copying the items to a new list:,
78,"For example, if passed the following:","This is the first google hit for ""python test empty array"" and similar queries, plus other people seem to be generalizing the question beyond just lists, so I thought I'd add a caveat for a different type of sequence that a lot of people might use.",
81,What's the difference between the list methods append() and extend()?,"append adds an element to a list, and extend concatenates the first list with another list (or another iterable, not necessarily a list.)",
87,What is __init__.py for in a Python source directory?,"In addition to labeling a directory as a Python package and defining __all__, __init__.py allows you to define any variable at the package level. Doing so is often convenient if a package defines something that will be imported frequently, in an API-like fashion. This pattern promotes adherence to the Pythonic ""flat is better than nested"" philosophy.",
90,Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:,"Actually, this is not a design flaw, and it is not because of internals or performance.
It comes simply from the fact that functions in Python are first-class objects, and not only a piece of code.",
93,Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:,I know nothing about the Python interpreter inner workings (and I'm not an expert in compilers and interpreters either) so don't blame me if I propose anything unsensible or impossible.,
94,Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:,"Well, the reason is quite simply that bindings are done when code is executed, and the function definition is executed, well... when the functions is defined.",
101,"The Python documentation seems unclear about whether parameters are passed by reference or value, and the following code produces the unchanged value 'Original'","The problem comes from a misunderstanding of what variables are in Python. If you're used to most traditional languages, you have a mental model of what happens in the following sequence:",
102,"The Python documentation seems unclear about whether parameters are passed by reference or value, and the following code produces the unchanged value 'Original'","I found the other answers rather long and complicated, so I created this simple diagram to explain the way Python treats variables and parameters.
",
104,"The Python documentation seems unclear about whether parameters are passed by reference or value, and the following code produces the unchanged value 'Original'","Think of stuff being passed by assignment instead of by reference/by value. That way, it is always clear, what is happening as long as you understand what happens during the normal assignment.",
105,"While using new_list = my_list, any modifications to new_list changes my_list every time. Why is this, and how can I clone or copy the list to prevent it?","With new_list = my_list, you don't actually have two lists. The assignment just copies the reference to the list, not the actual list, so both new_list and my_list refer to the same list after the assignment.",
109,"While using new_list = my_list, any modifications to new_list changes my_list every time. Why is this, and how can I clone or copy the list to prevent it?","There are many answers already that tell you how to make a proper copy, but none of them say why your original 'copy' failed. ",

113,How can I make two decorators in Python that would do the following?,It looks like the other people have already told you how to solve the problem. I hope this will help you understand what decorators are.,
115,"I'm trying to understand the use of super(). From the looks of it, both child classes can be created, just fine. ","super() lets you avoid referring to the base class explicitly, which can be nice. But the main advantage comes with multiple inheritance, where all sorts of fun stuff can happen. See the standard docs on super if you haven't already.",
116,"I'm trying to understand the use of super(). From the looks of it, both child classes can be created, just fine. ",The reason we use super is so that child classes that may be using cooperative multiple inheritance will call the correct next parent class function in the Method Resolution Order (MRO).,
119,"I'm trying to understand the use of super(). From the looks of it, both child classes can be created, just fine. ","Just a heads up... with Python 2.7, and I believe ever since super() was introduced in version 2.2, you can only call super() if one of the parents inherit from a class that eventually inherits object (new-style classes).",
120,"In the following method definitions, what does the * and ** do for param2?",The *args and **kwargs is a common idiom to allow arbitrary number of arguments to functions as described in the section more on defining functions in the Python documentation.,
121,"In the following method definitions, what does the * and ** do for param2?","It's also worth noting that you can use * and ** when calling functions as well. This is a shortcut that allows you to pass multiple arguments to a function directly using either a list/tuple or a dictionary. For example, if you have the following function:",
122,"In the following method definitions, what does the * and ** do for param2?","The single * means that there can be any number of extra positional arguments. foo() can be invoked like foo(1,2,3,4,5). In the body of foo() param2 is a sequence containing 2-5.",
123,"In the following method definitions, what does the * and ** do for param2?","They allow for functions to be defined to accept and for users to pass any number of arguments, positional (*) and keyword (**).",
124,"In the following method definitions, what does the * and ** do for param2?","Let us first understand what are positional arguments and keyword arguments.
Below is an example of function definition with Positional arguments.",
128,How can I select rows from a DataFrame based on values in some column in Pandas?,"I find the syntax of the previous answers to be redundant and difficult to remember. Pandas introduced the query() method in v0.13 and I much prefer it. For your question, you could do df.query('col == val')",
132,How do you change the size of figure drawn with Matplotlib?,"There is also this workaround in case you want to change the size without using the figure environment. So in case you are using plt.plot() for example, you can set a tuple with width and height.",
133,How do you change the size of figure drawn with Matplotlib?,"Deprecation note:
  As per the official Matplotlib guide, usage of the pylab module is no longer recommended. Please consider using the matplotlib.pyplot module instead, as described by this other answer.",
136,How can I raise an exception in Python so that it can later be caught via an except block?,DON'T DO THIS. Raising a bare Exception is absolutely not the right thing to do; see Aaron Hall's excellent answer instead.,
138,How can I raise an exception in Python so that it can later be caught via an except block?,"For the common case where you need to throw an exception in response to some unexpected conditions, and that you never intend to catch, but simply to fail fast to enable you to debug from there if it ever happens — the most logical one seems to be AssertionError:",
140,How can I output colored text to the terminal in Python?,"This somewhat depends on what platform you are on. The most common way to do this is by printing ANSI escape sequences. For a simple example, here's some Python code from the Blender build scripts:",

160,pip is a replacement for easy_install. But should I install pip using easy_install on Windows? Is there a better way?,"Good news! Python 3.4 (released March 2014) and Python 2.7.9 (released December 2014) ship with Pip. This is the best feature of any Python release. It makes the community's wealth of libraries accessible to everyone. Newbies are no longer excluded from using community libraries by the prohibitive difficulty of setup.
