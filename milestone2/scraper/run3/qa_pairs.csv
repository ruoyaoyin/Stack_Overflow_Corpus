How would one create an iterative function (or iterator object) in python?,"Iterator objects in python conform to the iterator protocol, which basically means they provide two methods: __iter__()  and  __next__().  "

"What is the python keyword ""with"" used for?","In python the with keyword is used when working with unmanaged resources (like file streams). It is similar to the using statement in VB.NET and C#. It allows you to ensure that a resource is ""cleaned up"" when the code that uses it finishes running, even if exceptions are thrown. It provides 'syntactic sugar' for try/finally blocks."
"What is the python keyword ""with"" used for?",Explanation from the Pershing on Programming blog:
"Sometimes I want to just insert some print statements in my code, and see what gets printed out when I exercise it. My usual way to ""exercise"" it is with existing pytest tests. But when I run these, I don't seem able to see any standard output (at least from within PyCharm, my IDE).",The -s switch disables per-test capturing (only if a test fails).

I understand how this construct works:,A common construct is to run a loop until something is found and then to break out of the loop. The problem is that if I break out of the loop or the loop ends I need to determine which case happened. One method is to create a flag or store variable that will let me do a second test to see how the loop was exited.
I understand how this construct works:,"It's a strange construct even to seasoned Python coders. When used in conjunction with for-loops it basically means ""find some item in the iterable, else if none was found do ..."". As in:"

I can't figure out how to use an array or matrix in the way that I would normally use a list. I want to create an empty array (or matrix) and then add one column (or row) to it at a time.,"You have the wrong mental model for using NumPy efficiently. NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory. If you want to add rows or columns to an existing array, the entire array needs to be copied to a new block of memory, creating gaps for the new elements to be stored. This is very inefficient if done repeatedly to build an array."
I can't figure out how to use an array or matrix in the way that I would normally use a list. I want to create an empty array (or matrix) and then add one column (or row) to it at a time.,"A NumPy array is a very different data structure from a list and is designed to be used in different ways.  Your use of hstack is potentially very inefficient... every time you call it, all the data in the existing array is copied into a new one. (The append function will have the same issue.)  If you want to build up your matrix one column at a time, you might be best off to keep it in a list until it is finished, and only then convert it into an array."
"Unless I'm mistaken, creating a function in Python works like this:",The other answers have done a good job at explaining duck typing and the simple answer by tzot:
