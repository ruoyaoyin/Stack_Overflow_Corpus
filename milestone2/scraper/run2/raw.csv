"
"
","<p>I will give a practical example in scraping web data using python, a lot of the times you will get keys with no values, in those cases you will get errors if you use dictionary['key'], whereas dictionary.get('key', 'return_otherwise') has no problems.</p>","
","<p>Similarly, I would use ''.join(list) as opposed to list[0] if you try to capture a single value from a list.</p>","
",<p>hope it helps.</p>,"
",<p>[Edit] Here is a practical example:</p>,"
","<p>Say, you are calling an API, which returns a JOSN file you need to parse. The first JSON looks like following:</p>","
","<pre><code>{""bids"":{""id"":16210506,""submitdate"":""2011-10-16 15:53:25"",""submitdate_f"":""10\/16\/2011 at 21:53 CEST"",""submitdate_f2"":""p\u0159ed 2 lety"",""submitdate_ts"":1318794805,""users_id"":""2674360"",""project_id"":""1250499""}}
</code></pre>","
",<p>The second JOSN is like this:</p>,"
","<pre><code>{""bids"":{""id"":16210506,""submitdate"":""2011-10-16 15:53:25"",""submitdate_f"":""10\/16\/2011 at 21:53 CEST"",""submitdate_f2"":""p\u0159ed 2 lety"",""users_id"":""2674360"",""project_id"":""1250499""}}
</code></pre>","
","<p>Note that the second JSON is missing the ""submitdate_ts"" key, which is pretty normal in any data structure.</p>","
","<p>So when you try to access the value of that key in a loop, can you call it with the following:</p>","
","<pre><code>for item in API_call:
    submitdate_ts = item[""bids""][""submitdate_ts""]
</code></pre>","
","<p>You could, but it will give you a traceback error for the second JSON line, because the key simply doesn't exist.</p>","
","<p>The appropriate way of coding this, could be the following:</p>","
","<pre><code>for item in API_call:
    submitdate_ts = item.get(""bids"", {'x': None}).get(""submitdate_ts"")
</code></pre>","
",<p>{'x': None} is there to avoid the second level getting an error. Of course you can build in more fault tolerance into the code if you are doing scraping. Like first specifying a if condition</p>,"
"
"
",<p>A gotcha to be aware of when using <code>.get()</code>:</p>,"
","<p>If the dictionary contains the key used in the call to <code>.get()</code> and its value is <code>None</code>, the <code>.get()</code> method will return <code>None</code> even if a default value is supplied.</p>","
","<p>For example, the following returns <code>None</code>, not <code>'alt_value'</code> as may be expected:</p>","
","<pre><code>d = {'key': None}
assert None is d.get('key', 'alt_value')
</code></pre>","
","<p><code>.get()</code>'s second value is only returned if the key supplied is NOT in the dictionary, not if the return value of that call is <code>None</code>.</p>","
"
"
","<p>The purpose is that you can give a default value if the key is not found, which is very useful</p>","
","<pre><code>dictionary.get(""Name"",'harry')

","<blockquote>

",<p>One particular usage is counting with a dictionary. Let's assume you want to count the number of occurrences of each element in a given list. The common way to do so is to make a dictionary where keys are elements and values are the number of occurrences.</p>,"

","<p>Other <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/37968524/6243352"">answers</a> have clearly explained the difference between dict bracket keying and <code>.get</code> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/57582439/6243352"">mentioned a <em>fairly</em> innocuous pitfall</a> when <code>None</code> or the default value is also a valid key.</p>","
","<p>Given this information, it may be tempting conclude that <code>.get</code> is somehow safer and better than bracket indexing and should always be used instead of bracket lookups, as argued in <a href=""https://medium.com/better-programming/stop-using-square-bracket-notation-to-get-a-dictionarys-value-in-python-c617f6ea15a3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Stop Using Square Bracket Notation to Get a Dictionary's Value in Python</em></a>, even in the common case when they expect the lookup to succeed (i.e. never raise a <code>KeyError</code>).</p>","
","<p>The author of the blog post argues that <code>.get</code> ""safeguards your code"":</p>","
","<blockquote>
<p>Notice how trying to reference a term that doesn't exist causes a <code>KeyError</code>. This can cause major headaches, especially when dealing with unpredictable business data.</p>
<p>While we could wrap our statement in a <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> or <code>if</code> statement, this much care for a dictionary term will quickly pile up.</p>
</blockquote>","
","<p>It's true that in the uncommon case for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">null</a> (<code>None</code>)-coalescing or otherwise filling in a missing value to handle unpredictable dynamic data, a judiciously-deployed <code>.get</code> is a useful and Pythonic shorthand tool for ungainly <code>if key in dct:</code> and <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> blocks that only exist to set default values when the key might be missing as part of the behavioral specification for the program.</p>","
","<p>However, replacing <em>all</em> bracket dict lookups, including those that you assert must succeed, with <code>.get</code> is a different matter. This practice effectively downgrades a class of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error_detection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">runtime errors</a> that help reveal bugs into silent illegal state scenarios that tend to be harder to identify and debug.</p>","
","<p>A common mistake among programmers is to think exceptions <em>cause</em> headaches and attempt to suppress them, using techniques like wrapping code in <a href=""https://wiki.c2.com/?PokemonExceptionHandling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>try</code> ... <code>except: pass</code> blocks</a>. They later realize the <em>real</em> headache is never seeing the breach of application logic at the point of failure and deploying a broken application. Better programming practice is to embrace assertions for all program invariants such as keys that must be in a dictionary.</p>","
","<p>The hierarchy of error safety is, broadly:</p>","
","<div class=""s-table-container"">
<table class=""s-table"">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Error category</th>
<th>Relative ease of debugging</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Compile-time error</td>
<td>Easy; go to the line and fix the problem</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Runtime exception</td>
<td>Medium; control needs to flow to the error and it may be due to unanticipated edge cases or hard-to-reproduce state like a race condition between threads, but at least we get a clear error message and stack trace when it does happen.</td>
</tr>

<td>Silent logical error</td>
<td>Difficult; we may not even know it exists, and when we do, tracking down state that caused it can be very challenging due to lack of locality and potential for multiple assertion breaches.</td>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>","
","<p>When programming language designers talk about program safety, a major goal is to surface, not suppress, genuine errors by promoting runtime errors to compile-time errors and promote silent logical errors to either runtime exceptions or (ideally) compile-time errors.</p>","
","<p>Python, by design as an interpreted language, relies heavily on runtime exceptions instead of compiler errors. Missing methods or properties, illegal type operations like <code>1 + ""a""</code> and out of bounds or missing indices or keys raise by default.</p>","
","<p>Some languages like JS, Java, Rust and Go use the fallback behavior for their maps by default (and in many cases, don't provide a throw/raise alternative), but Python throws by default, along with other languages like C#. Perl/PHP issue an uninitialized value warning.</p>","
","<p>Indiscriminate application of <code>.get</code> to all dict accesses, even those that aren't expected to fail and have no fallback for dealing with <code>None</code> (or whatever default is used) running amok through the code, pretty much tosses away Python's runtime exception safety net for this class of errors, silencing or adding indirection to potential bugs.</p>","
","<p>Other supporting reasons to prefer bracket lookups (with the occasional, well-placed <code>.get</code> where a default is expected):</p>","
","<ul>
<li>Prefer writing standard, idiomatic code using the tools provided by the language. Python programmers usually (correctly) prefer brackets for the exception safety reasons given above and because it's the default behavior for Python dicts.</li>
<li>Always using <code>.get</code> forfeits intent by making cases when you expect to provide a default <code>None</code> value indistinguishable from a lookup you assert must succeed.</li>
<li>Testing increases in complexity in proportion to the new ""legal"" program paths permitted by <code>.get</code>. Effectively, each lookup is now a branch that can succeed or fail -- both cases must be tested to establish coverage, even if the default path is effectively unreachable by specification (ironically leading to additional <code>if val is not None:</code> or <code>try</code> for all future uses of the retrieved value; unnecessary and confusing for something that should never be <code>None</code> in the first place).</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39582115/python-dictionary-lookup-performance-get-vs-in""><code>.get</code> is a bit slower</a>.</li>
<li><code>.get</code> is harder to type and uglier to read (compare Java's tacked-on-feel <code>ArrayList</code> syntax to native-feel C# <code>Lists</code> or C++ vector code). Minor.</li>
</ul>","
","<p>Some languages like C++ and Ruby offer alternate methods (<code>at</code> and <code>fetch</code>, respectively) to opt-in to throwing an error on a bad access, while C# offers opt-in fallback value <code>TryGetValue</code> similar to Python's <code>get</code>.</p>","
","<p>Since JS, Java, Ruby, Go and Rust bake the fallback approach of <code>.get</code> into all hash lookups by default, it can't be that bad, one might think. It's true that this isn't the largest issue facing language designers and there are plenty of use cases for the no-throw access version, so it's unsurprising that there's no consensus across languages.</p>","
","<p>But as I've argued, Python (along with C#) has done better than these languages by making the assert option the default. It's a loss of safety and expressivity to opt-out of using it to report contract violations at the point of failure by indiscriminately using <code>.get</code> across the board.</p>","

"
"
",<h2>What is this warning about?</h2>,"
","<p>Modern CPUs provide a lot of low-level instructions, besides the usual arithmetic and logic, known as extensions, e.g. SSE2, SSE4, AVX, etc. From the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>","
","<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advanced Vector Extensions</strong> (<strong>AVX</strong>) are extensions to the x86 instruction
set architecture for microprocessors from Intel and AMD proposed by
Intel in March 2008 and first supported by Intel with the Sandy
Bridge processor shipping in Q1 2011 and later on by AMD with the
Bulldozer processor shipping in Q3 2011. AVX provides new features,
new instructions and a new coding scheme.</p>
</blockquote>","
","<p>In particular, AVX introduces <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply%E2%80%93accumulate_operation#Fused_multiply.E2.80.93add"" rel=""noreferrer"">fused multiply-accumulate</a> (FMA) operations, which speed up linear algebra computation, namely dot-product, matrix multiply, convolution, etc. Almost every machine-learning training involves a great deal of these operations, hence will be faster on a CPU that supports AVX and FMA (up to 300%). The warning states that your CPU does support AVX (hooray!).</p>","
",<p>I'd like to stress here: it's all about <strong>CPU only</strong>.</p>,"
",<h2>Why isn't it used then?</h2>,"
","<p>Because tensorflow default distribution is built <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7778"" rel=""noreferrer"">without CPU extensions</a>, such as SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, FMA, etc. The default builds (ones from <code>pip install tensorflow</code>) are intended to be compatible with as many CPUs as possible. Another argument is that even with these extensions CPU is a lot slower than a GPU, and it's expected for medium- and large-scale machine-learning training to be performed on a GPU.</p>","
",<h2>What should you do?</h2>,"
","<p><strong>If you have a GPU</strong>, you shouldn't care about AVX support, because most expensive ops will be dispatched on a GPU device (unless explicitly set not to). In this case, you can simply ignore this warning by</p>","
","<pre><code># Just disables the warning, doesn't take advantage of AVX/FMA to run faster
import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'
</code></pre>","
","<p>... or by setting <code>export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2</code> if you're on Unix. Tensorflow is working fine anyway, but you won't see these annoying warnings.</p>","
",<hr/>,"
","<p><strong>If you don't have a GPU</strong> and want to utilize CPU as much as possible, <strong>you should build tensorflow from the source optimized for <em>your</em> CPU</strong> with AVX, AVX2, and FMA enabled if your CPU supports them. It's been discussed in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/41293077/712995"">this question</a> and also <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/8037"" rel=""noreferrer"">this GitHub issue</a>. Tensorflow uses an ad-hoc build system called <a href=""https://bazel.build/"" rel=""noreferrer"">bazel</a> and building it is not that trivial, but is certainly doable. After this, not only will the warning disappear, tensorflow performance should also improve.</p>","

",<h1>CPU optimization with GPU</h1>,"
",<p>There are performance gains you can get by installing TensorFlow from the source even if you have a GPU and use it for training and inference.  The reason is that some TF operations only have CPU implementation and cannot run on your GPU.</p>,"
","<p>Also, there are some performance enhancement tips that makes good use of your CPU.  <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_guide"" rel=""noreferrer"">TensorFlow's performance guide</a> recommends the following:</p>","
","<blockquote>
<p>Placing input pipeline operations on the CPU can significantly improve performance. Utilizing the CPU for the input pipeline frees the GPU to focus on training.</p>
</blockquote>","
","<p>For best performance, you should write your code to utilize your CPU and GPU to work in tandem, and not dump it all on your GPU if you have one. 
 Having your TensorFlow binaries optimized for your CPU could pay off hours of saved running time and you have to do it once.</p>","

","<p>If you use the <strong>pip</strong> version of TensorFlow, it means it's already compiled and you are just installing it. Basically you install TensorFlow-GPU, but when you download it from the repository and trying to build it, you should build it with CPU AVX support. If you ignore it, you will get a warning every time when you run on the CPU. You can take a look at those too.</p>","

",<hr/>,"
","<p><em>edit</em>: Though initially I thought these methods were really bad (unless you use many fallbacks, the code may be irrelevant many years from now), it does pose the question ""what is the internet?"". A computer may have many interfaces pointing to many different networks. For a more thorough description of the topic, google for <code>gateways and routes</code>. A computer may be able to access an internal network via an internal gateway, or access the world-wide web via a gateway on for example a router (usually the case). The local IP address that the OP asks about is only well-defined with respect to a single link layer, so you have to specify that (""is it the network card, or the ethernet cable, which we're talking about?""). There may be multiple non-unique answers to this question as posed. However the global IP address on the world-wide web is probably well-defined (in the absence of massive network fragmentation): probably the return path via the gateway which can access the TLDs.</p>","

",<p>I've tried to find a comprehensive guide on whether it is best to use <code>import module</code> or <code>from module import</code>. I've just started with Python and I'm trying to start off with best practices in mind.</p>,"
","<p>Basically, I was hoping if anyone could share their experiences, what preferences other developers have and what's the best way to avoid any <em>gotchas</em> down the road?</p>","
"
"
",<p>The difference between <code>import module</code> and <code>from module import foo</code> is mainly subjective.  Pick the one you like best and be consistent in your use of it.  Here are some points to help you decide.</p>,"
",<p><code>import module</code></p>,"
","<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Less maintenance of your <code>import</code> statements. Don't need to add any additional imports to start using another item from the module</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Typing <code>module.foo</code> in your code can be tedious and redundant (tedium can be minimized by using <code>import module as mo</code> then typing <code>mo.foo</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>","
",<p><code>from module import foo</code></p>,"
","<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Less typing to use <code>foo</code></li>
<li>More control over which items of a module can be accessed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To use a new item from the module you have to update your <code>import</code> statement</li>
<li>You lose context about <code>foo</code>. For example, it's less clear what <code>ceil()</code> does compared to <code>math.ceil()</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>","
","<p>Either method is acceptable, but <strong>don't</strong> use <code>from module import *</code>.  </p>","
","<p>For any reasonable large set of code, if you <code>import *</code> you will likely be cementing it into the module, unable to be removed.  This is because it is difficult to determine what items used in the code are coming from 'module', making it easy to get to the point where you think you don't use the <code>import</code> any more but it's extremely difficult to be sure.</p>","
"
"
","<p>There's another detail here, not mentioned, related to writing to a module. Granted this may not be very common, but I've needed it from time to time.</p>","
","<p>Due to the way references and name binding works in Python, if you want to update some symbol in a module, say foo.bar, from outside that module, and have other importing code ""see"" that change, you have to import foo a certain way. For example:</p>","
",<p>module foo:</p>,"
","<pre><code>bar = ""apples""
</code></pre>","
",<p>module a:</p>,"
","<pre><code>import foo
foo.bar = ""oranges""   # update bar inside foo module object
</code></pre>","
",<p>module b:</p>,"
","<pre><code>import foo           
print foo.bar        # if executed after a's ""foo.bar"" assignment, will print ""oranges""
</code></pre>","
","<p>However, if you import symbol names instead of module names, this will not work.</p>","
","<p>For example, if I do this in module a:</p>","
","<pre><code>from foo import bar
bar = ""oranges""
</code></pre>","
","<p>No code outside of <code>a</code> will see <code>bar</code> as ""oranges"" because my setting of <code>bar</code> merely affected the name ""bar"" inside module <code>a</code>, it did not ""reach into"" the <code>foo</code> module object and update its <code>bar</code>.</p>","
"
"
","<p>Even though many people already explained about <code>import</code> vs <code>import from</code>, I want to try to explain a bit more about what happens under the hood, and where all the places it changes are.</p>","

",<p>If module <code>foo</code> uses a following import:</p>,"

","<p>the mistake is still possible, but less likely to be made. <code>bar</code> needs to:</p>","
","<pre><code>import foo

</code></pre>","
","<p>This caused some troubles to me. I had a module that by mistake imported an exception from a module that did not define it, only imported it from other module (using <code>from module import SomeException</code>).

"
"
","<p>Here is another difference not mentioned.  This is copied verbatim from <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html</a></p>","
",<p>Note that when using </p>,"
","<pre><code>from package import item
</code></pre>","
","<p>the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in the package, like a function, class or variable. The import statement first tests whether the item is defined in the package; if not, it assumes it is a module and attempts to load it. If it fails to find it, an ImportError exception is raised.</p>","
","<p>Contrarily, when using syntax like </p>","
","<pre><code>import item.subitem.subsubitem
</code></pre>","
",<p>each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module or a package but can’t be a class or function or variable defined in the previous item.</p>,"
"
"
","<p>Since I am also a beginner, I will be trying to explain this in a simple way:
In Python, we have three types of <code>import</code> statements which are:</p>","
",<p><strong>1. Generic imports:</strong></p>,"
","<pre><code>import math
</code></pre>","
","<p><em>this type of import is my personal favorite, the only downside to this import technique is that if you need use any module's function you must use the following syntax:</em></p>","
","<pre><code>math.sqrt(4)
</code></pre>","
","<p><em>of course, it increases the typing effort but as a beginner, it will help you to keep track of module and function associated with it, (a good text editor will reduce the typing effort significantly and is recommended).</em></p>","
",<p><em><strong>Typing effort can be further reduced by using this import statement:</strong></em></p>,"
","<pre><code>import math as m
</code></pre>","
","<p><em>now, instead of using <code>math.sqrt()</code> you can use <code>m.sqrt()</code>.</em></p>","
",<p><strong>2. Function imports:</strong></p>,"
","<pre><code>from math import sqrt
</code></pre>","
","<p><em>this type of import is best suited if your code only needs to access single or few functions from the module, but for using any new item from the module you have to update import statement.</em></p>","
",<p><strong>3. Universal imports:</strong></p>,"
","<pre><code>from math import * 
</code></pre>","
","<p><em>Although it reduces typing effort significantly but is not recommended because it will fill your code with various functions from the module and their name could conflict with the name of user-defined functions.</em>
<strong>example:</strong></p>","
","<h3>If you have a function of your very own named sqrt and you import math, your function is safe: there is your sqrt and there is math.sqrt. If you do from math import *, however, you have a problem: namely, two different functions with the exact same name.

"
"
","<pre><code>import package
import module
</code></pre>","
","<p>With <code>import</code>, the token must be a module (a file containing Python commands) or a package (a folder in the <code>sys.path</code> containing a file <code>__init__.py</code>.)</p>","
",<p>When there are subpackages:</p>,"
","<pre><code>import package1.package2.package
import package1.package2.module
</code></pre>","
","<p>the requirements for folder (package) or file (module) are the same, but the folder or file must be inside <code>package2</code> which must be inside <code>package1</code>, and both <code>package1</code> and <code>package2</code> must contain <code>__init__.py</code> files. <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html</a></p>","
",<p>With the <code>from</code> style of import:</p>,"
","<pre><code>from package1.package2 import package
from package1.package2 import module
</code></pre>","
",<p>the package or module enters the namespace of the file containing the <code>import</code> statement as <code>module</code> (or <code>package</code>) instead of <code>package1.package2.module</code>. You can always bind to a more convenient name:</p>,"
","<pre><code>a = big_package_name.subpackage.even_longer_subpackage_name.function
</code></pre>","
",<p>Only the <code>from</code> style of import permits you to name a particular function or variable:</p>,"
","<pre><code>from package3.module import some_function
</code></pre>","
","<p>is allowed, but</p>","
","<pre><code>import package3.module.some_function 
</code></pre>","
",<p>is not allowed.</p>,"
"
"
","<p>To add to what people have said about <code>from x import *</code>: besides making it more difficult to tell where names came from, this throws off code checkers like Pylint.  They will report those names as undefined variables.</p>","

","<p>My own answer to this depends mostly on first, how many different modules I'll be using.  If i'm only going to use one or two, I'll often use <strong><code>from</code></strong> ... <strong><code>import</code></strong> since it makes for fewer keystrokes in the rest of the file, but if I'm going to make use of many different modules, I prefer just <strong><code>import</code></strong> because that means that each module reference is self-documenting.  I can see where each symbol comes from without having to hunt around.</p>","
","<p>Usuaully I prefer the self documenting style of plain import and only change to from.. import when the number of times I have to type the module name grows above 10 to 20, even if there's only one module being imported.</p>","
"

","<p>One of the significant difference I found out which <em>surprisingly</em> no-one has talked about is that using plain <em>import</em> you can access <code>private variable</code> and <code>private functions</code> from the imported module, which isn't possible with <em>from-import</em> statement. </p>","

",<p>Use of <strong>mymath</strong>:</p>,"
","<pre><code>import mymath

","<p>If I imported <code>gcd</code> only for internal use, not to disclose it to users of <code>mymath</code>, this can be inconvenient. I have this pretty often, and in most cases I want to ""keep my modules clean"".</p>","
","<p>Apart from the proposal of <em>Jan Wrobel</em> to obscure this a bit more by using <code>import math</code> instead, I have started to hide imports from disclosure by using a leading underscore:</p>","

# or...
import math as _math

","<p>In larger projects this ""best practice"" allows my to exactly control what is disclosed to subsequent imports and what isn't. This keeps my modules clean and pays back at a certain size of project.</p>","

","<p>There are some builtin modules that contain mostly bare functions (<a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">base64</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">math</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">os</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shutil</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sys</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">time</a>, ...) and it is definitely a good practice to have these bare functions <em>bound</em> to some namespace and thus improve the readability of your code.

On the other hand there are some modules that contain mostly classes (<a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">configparser</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">datetime</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tempfile</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">zipfile</a>, ...) and many of them make their class names self-explanatory enough:</p>","

","<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When the Python interpreter is invoked with the -O flag, optimized code is generated and stored in ‘.pyo’ files. The optimizer currently doesn't help much; it only removes assert statements. When -O is used, all bytecode is optimized; .pyc files are ignored and .py files are compiled to optimized bytecode.</li>
<li>Passing two -O flags to the Python interpreter (-OO) will cause the bytecode compiler to perform optimizations that could in some rare cases result in malfunctioning programs. Currently only <code>__doc__</code> strings are removed from the bytecode, resulting in more compact ‘.pyo’ files. Since some programs may rely on having these available, you should only use this option if you know what you're doing.</li>
<li>A program doesn't run any faster when it is read from a ‘.pyc’ or ‘.pyo’ file than when it is read from a ‘.py’ file; the only thing that's faster about ‘.pyc’ or ‘.pyo’ files is the speed with which they are loaded.</li>
<li>When a script is run by giving its name on the command line, the bytecode for the script is never written to a ‘.pyc’ or ‘.pyo’ file. Thus, the startup time of a script may be reduced by moving most of its code to a module and having a small bootstrap script that imports that module. It is also possible to name a ‘.pyc’ or ‘.pyo’ file directly on the command line.</li>

",<p>Since Python 3.0 you have to write:</p>,"
","<pre><code>print(""Hello, World!"")
</code></pre>","
",<p>And someone has still to write that <code>antigravity</code> library :(</p>,"
"
"
","<p>There is a change in syntax from Python 2 to Python 3.
In Python 2,</p>","
","<pre><code>print ""Hello, World!"" 
</code></pre>","
","<p>will work but in Python 3, use parentheses as </p>","
","<pre><code>print(""Hello, World!"")
</code></pre>","
",<p>This is equivalent syntax to Scala and near to Java.</p>,"
"
"
","<p>Basically, since Python 3.x you need to use <code>print</code> with parenthesis.</p>","

","<hr>
<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p><strong><code>print</code></strong> was a <strong>statement</strong> in <strong>2.x</strong>, but it's a <strong>function</strong> in <strong>3.x</strong>. Now, there are a number of good reasons for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>With function format of Python 3.x, more flexibility comes when printing multiple items with comma separated.</li>
<li>You can't use argument splatting with a statement. In 3.x if you have a list of items that you want to print with a separator, you can do this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; items = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(*items, sep='+')
foo+bar+baz
</code></pre>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>You can't override a statement. If you want to change the behavior of print, you can do that when it's a function but not when it's a statement.</li>
</ol>
</hr>"
"
","<p>If your code should work in both Python 2 and 3, you can achieve this by loading this at the beginning of your program:</p>","
","<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function   # If code has to work in Python 2 and 3!
</code></pre>","
",<p>Then you can print in the Python 3 way:</p>,"
","<pre><code>print(""python"")
</code></pre>","
",<p>If you want to print something without creating a new line - you can do this:</p>,"
","<pre><code>for number in range(0, 10):
    print(number, end=', ')
</code></pre>","
"
"
","<p>In Python 3, you can only print as:</p>","
","<pre><code>print(""STRING"")
</code></pre>","
","<p>But in Python 2, the parentheses are not necessary.</p>","
"
"
","<p>I could also just add that I knew everything about the syntax change between <code>Python2.7</code> and <code>Python3</code>, and my code was correctly written as <code>print(""string"")</code> and even 
<code>print(f""string"")</code>... </p>","
",<p>But after some time of debugging I realized that my bash script was calling python like: </p>,"
","<blockquote>
<p>python file_name.py</p>
</blockquote>","
",<p>which had the effect of calling my python script by default using <code>python2.7</code> which gave the error. So I changed my bash script to:</p>,"
","<blockquote>
<p>python3 file_name.py</p>
</blockquote>","
",<p>which of coarse uses python3 to run the script which fixed the error.</p>,"
"
"
","<p>Outside of the direct answers here, one should note the other key difference between python 2 and 3. The <a href=""https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official python wiki</a> goes into almost all of the major differences and focuses on when you should use either of the versions. <a href=""https://learntocodewith.me/programming/python/python-2-vs-python-3/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This blog post</a> also does a fine job of explaining the current python universe and the somehow unsolved puzzle of moving to python 3.</p>","
","<p>As far as I can tell, you are beginning to learn the python language. You should consider the aforementioned articles before you continue down the python 3 route. Not only will you have to change some of your syntax, you will also need to think about which packages will be available to you (an advantage of python 2) and potential optimizations that could be made in your code (an advantage of python 3).</p>","
"
"
","<p><code>print('Hello, World!')</code></p>","

","<p>This is a Python package error, in which Python2 has been used and you are probably running this on Python3.</p>","
","<p>One solution could be to convert Python2 <code>print something</code> to Python3 <code>print(something)</code> for every line in each file in the package folder, which is not a good idea😅. I mean, you can do it but still there are better ways.</p>","
","<p>To perform the same task, there is a package named <strong>2to3</strong> in Python which converts Python2 scripts to Python3 scripts. To install it, execute the 👇 command in terminal..</p>","

","<pre><code>execfile(""script2.py 1"")

","<p>But it is not accepting variables properly. When I print out the <code>sys.argv</code> in script2.py it is the original command call to first script ""['C:\script1.py'].</p>","
",<p>I don't really want to change the original script (i.e. script2.py in my example) since I don't own it.</p>,"
",<p>I figure there must be a way to do this; I am just confused how you do it.</p>,"
"
"
","<p>Try using <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.system""><code>os.system</code></a>:</p>","
","<pre><code>os.system(""script2.py 1"")
</code></pre>","
",<p><code>execfile</code> is different because it is designed to run a sequence of Python statements in the <em>current</em> execution context. That's why <code>sys.argv</code> didn't change for you.</p>,"
"
"
","<p>This is inherently the wrong thing to do. If you are running a Python script from another Python script, you should communicate through Python instead of through the OS:</p>","
","<pre><code>import script1
</code></pre>","
","<p>In an ideal world, you will be able to call a function inside <code>script1</code> directly:</p>","
","<pre><code>for i in range(whatever):
    script1.some_function(i)
</code></pre>","
","<p>If necessary, you can hack <code>sys.argv</code>. There's a neat way of doing this using a context manager to ensure that you don't make any permanent changes.</p>","
","<pre><code>import contextlib
@contextlib.contextmanager
def redirect_argv(num):
    sys._argv = sys.argv[:]
    sys.argv=[str(num)]
    yield

with redirect_argv(1):
    print(sys.argv)
</code></pre>","
",<p>I think this is preferable to passing all your data to the OS and back; that's just silly.</p>,"
"

","<p>Ideally, the Python script you want to run will be set up with code like this near the end:</p>","
","<pre><code>def main(arg1, arg2, etc):
    # do whatever the script does


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3])
</code></pre>","
","<p>In other words, <em>if</em> the module is called from the command line, it parses the command line options and then calls another function, <code>main()</code>, to do the actual work. (The actual arguments will vary, and the parsing may be more involved.)</p>","
","<p>If you want to call such a script from another Python script, however, you can simply <code>import</code> it and call <code>modulename.main()</code> directly, rather than going through the operating system.</p>","
","<p><code>os.system</code> will work, but it is the roundabout (read ""slow"") way to do it, as you are starting a whole new Python interpreter process each time for no raisin.</p>","

","<p>Pandas is based on NumPy arrays.
The key to speed with NumPy arrays is to perform your operations on the whole array at once, never row-by-row or item-by-item.</p>","

","<p>I believe the most simple and efficient way to loop through DataFrames is using numpy and numba.  In that case, looping can be approximately as fast as vectorized operations in many cases.  If numba is not an option, plain numpy is likely to be the next best option.  As has been noted many times, your default should be vectorization, but this answer merely considers efficient looping, given the decision to loop, for whatever reason.</p>","
","<p>For a test case, let's use the example from @DSM's answer of calculating a percentage change.  This is a very simple situation and as a practical matter you would not write a loop to calculate it, but as such it provides a reasonable baseline for timing vectorized approaches vs loops.</p>","
","<p>Let's set up the 4 approaches with a small DataFrame, and we'll time them on a larger dataset below.</p>","
","<pre><code>import pandas as pd

","<p>Summary:  for simple cases, like this one, you would go with (vectorized) pandas for simplicity and readability, and (vectorized) numpy for speed.  If you really need to use a loop, do it in numpy.  If numba is available, combine it with numpy for additional speed.  In this case, numpy + numba is almost as fast as vectorized numpy code.</p>","
",<p>Other details:</p>,"
","<ul>
<li>Not shown are various options like iterrows, itertuples, etc. which are orders of magnitude slower and really should never be used.</li>
<li>The timings here are fairly typical: numpy is faster than pandas and vectorized is faster than loops, but adding numba to numpy will often speed numpy up dramatically.</li>
<li>Everything except the pandas option requires converting the DataFrame column to a numpy array.  That conversion is included in the timings.</li>
<li>The time to define/compile the numpy/numba functions was not included in the timings, but would generally be a negligible component of the timing for any large dataframe.</li>

",<p>It finally worked!</p>,"
"
"
","<p>What I understand from reading the documentation is that Python has a separate namespace for functions, and if I want to use a global variable in that function, I need to use <code>global</code>.</p>","
",<p>I'm using Python 2.7 and I tried this little test</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sub = ['0', '0', '0', '0']
&gt;&gt;&gt; def getJoin():
...     return '.'.join(sub)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; getJoin()
'0.0.0.0'
</code></pre>","
",<p>It seems things are working fine even without <code>global</code>. I was able to access global variable without any problem.</p>,"
","<p>Am I missing anything? Also, following is from Python documentation:</p>","
","<blockquote>
<p>Names listed in a global statement
  must not be defined as formal
  parameters or in a for loop control
  target, class definition, function
  definition, or import statement.</p>
</blockquote>","
","<p>While formal parameters and class definition make sense to me, I'm not able to understand the restriction on for loop control target and function definition.</p>","
"
"
","<p>The keyword <code>global</code> is only useful to change or create global variables in a local context, although creating global variables is seldom considered a good solution.</p>","
","<pre><code>def bob():
    me = ""locally defined""    # Defined only in local context
    print(me)

bob()
print(me)     # Asking for a global variable
</code></pre>","
",<p>The above will give you:</p>,"
","<pre><code>locally defined
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""file.py"", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    print(me)
NameError: name 'me' is not defined
</code></pre>","
","<p>While if you use the <code>global</code> statement, the variable will become available ""outside"" the scope of the function, effectively becoming a global variable.</p>","
","<pre><code>def bob():
    global me
    me = ""locally defined""   # Defined locally but declared as global
    print(me)

bob()
print(me)     # Asking for a global variable
</code></pre>","
",<p>So the above code will give you:</p>,"
","<pre><code>locally defined
locally defined
</code></pre>","
","<p>In addition, due to the nature of python, you could also use <code>global</code> to declare functions, classes or other objects in a local context. Although I would advise against it since it causes nightmares if something goes wrong or needs debugging.</p>","
"
"
","<p>While you can access global variables without the <code>global</code> keyword, if you want to modify them you have to use the <code>global</code> keyword. For example:</p>","
","<pre><code>foo = 1
def test():
    foo = 2 # new local foo

def blub():
    global foo
    foo = 3 # changes the value of the global foo
</code></pre>","
","<p>In your case, you're just accessing the list <code>sub</code>.</p>","
"
"
","<p>This is the difference between accessing the name and <a href=""http://docs.python.org/reference/executionmodel.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">binding</a> it within a scope.</p>","
","<p>If you're just looking up a variable to read its value, you've got access to global as well as local scope.</p>","
","<p>However if you assign to a variable who's name isn't in local scope, you are <em>binding</em> that name into this scope (and if that name also exists as a global, you'll hide that). </p>","
","<p>If you want to be able to assign to the global name, you need to tell the parser to use the global name rather than bind a new local name - which is what the 'global' keyword does.</p>","
","<p>Binding anywhere within a block causes the name everywhere in that block to become bound, which can cause some rather odd looking consequences (e.g. UnboundLocalError suddenly appearing in previously working code).</p>","
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; def p():
    print(a) # accessing global scope, no binding going on
&gt;&gt;&gt; def q():
    a = 3 # binding a name in local scope - hiding global
    print(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; def r():
    print(a) # fail - a is bound to local scope, but not assigned yet

UnboundLocalError: local variable 'a' referenced before assignment
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>","
"
"
",<p>The other answers answer your question. Another important thing to know about names in Python is that they are either local or global on a per-scope basis.</p>,"
","<p>Consider this, for example:</p>","
","<pre><code>value = 42

def doit():
    print value
    value = 0

doit()
print value
</code></pre>","
",<p>You can probably guess that the <code>value = 0</code> statement will be assigning to a local variable and not affect the value of the same variable declared outside the <code>doit()</code> function. You may be more surprised to discover that <em>the code above won't run.</em> The statement <code>print value</code> inside the function produces an <code>UnboundLocalError.</code></p>,"
","<p>The reason is that Python has noticed that, elsewhere in the function, you assign the name <code>value</code>, and also <code>value</code> is nowhere declared <code>global</code>. That makes it a local variable. But when you try to print it, the local name hasn't been defined yet. Python in this case <em>does not fall back</em> to looking for the name as a global variable, as some other languages do. Essentially, you cannot access a global variable if you have defined a local variable of the same name <em>anywhere</em> in the function.</p>","
"
"
","<p>Accessing a name and assigning a name are different. In your case, you are just accessing a name.</p>","
","<p>If you assign to a variable within a function, that variable is assumed to be local unless you declare it global. In the absence of that, it is assumed to be global.</p>","
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1         # global

"
","<ul>

","<blockquote>
<h1>What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?</h1>
<p>In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.</p>
<p>Though a bit surprising at first, a moment’s consideration explains this. On one hand, requiring <code>global</code> for assigned variables provides a bar against unintended side-effects. On the other hand, if <code>global</code> was required for all global references, you’d be using <code>global</code> all the time. You’d have to declare as <code>global</code> every reference to a built-in function or to a component of an imported module.

","<p>Any variable declared outside of a function is assumed to be global, it's only when declaring them from inside of functions (except constructors) that you must specify that the variable be global.</p>","
"
"
",<p>It means that you should not do the following:</p>,"
","<pre><code>x = 1

def myfunc():
  global x

  # formal parameter
  def localfunction(x):
    return x+1

  # import statement
  import os.path as x

  # for loop control target
  for x in range(10):
    print x

  # class definition
  class x(object):
    def __init__(self):
      pass

  #function definition
  def x():
    print ""I'm bad""
</code></pre>","
"

","<p>Global makes the variable ""Global""</p>","
","<pre><code>def out():
    global x
    x = 1
    print(x)
    return


out()

print (x)
</code></pre>","
",<p>This makes 'x' act like a normal variable outside the function. If you took the global out then it would give an error since it cannot print a variable inside a function.</p>,"
","<pre><code>def out():
     # Taking out the global will give you an error since the variable x is no longer 'global' or in other words: accessible for other commands
    x = 1

out()

print (x)

","<p><code>global</code> makes the variable visible to everything in the <em>module</em>, the <em>modular scope</em>, just as if you had defined it at top-level in the module itself. It's not visible outside the module, and it cannot be imported from the module until after it has been set, so don't bother, that's not what it is for.</p>","
",<p>When does <code>global</code> solve real problems? (Note: Checked only on Python 3.)</p>,"
","<pre><code># Attempt #1, will fail
# We cannot import ``catbus`` here

# do it automatically  when importing this module

def foo1():
    import catbus
    # Now ``catbus`` is visible for anything else defined inside ``foo()`` 
    # at *compile time*
    bar()  # But ``bar()`` is a call, not a definition. ``catbus`` 
           # is invisible to it.

def bar():
    # `bar()` sees what is defined in the module
    # This works:
    print(top_level_something_or_other)
    # This doesn't work, we get an exception: NameError: name 'catbus' is not defined
    catbus.run()

</code></pre>","
","<p>By defining <code>bar()</code> outside of <code>foo()</code>, <code>bar()</code> can be  imported into something that <em>can</em> import <code>catbus</code> directly, or mock it, like in a unit test.</p>","
","<p><code>global</code> is a code smell, but sometimes what you need is exactly a dirty hack like <code>global</code>. Anyway, ""global"" is a bad name for it as there is no such thing as global scope in python, it's modules all the way down.</p>","
