"Reading the changes in Python 3.1, I found something... unexpected:","Named tuples are basically easy-to-create, lightweight object types.  Named tuple instances can be referenced using object-like variable dereferencing or the standard tuple syntax.  They can be used similarly to struct or other common record types, except that they are immutable.  They were added in Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, although there is a recipe for implementation in Python 2.4."
"Reading the changes in Python 3.1, I found something... unexpected:",A named tuple is a tuple.

Should I put the shebang in my Python scripts? In what form?,"The shebang line in any script determines the script's ability to be executed like a standalone executable without typing python beforehand in the terminal or when double clicking it in a file manager (when configured properly). It isn't necessary but generally put there so when someone sees the file opened in an editor, they immediately know what they're looking at. However, which shebang line you use is important."
Should I put the shebang in my Python scripts? In what form?,It's really just a matter of taste. Adding the shebang means people can invoke the script directly if they want (assuming it's marked as executable); omitting it just means python has to be invoked manually.

"I am trying to understand the advantages of multiprocessing over threading. I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?","The threading module uses threads, the multiprocessing module uses processes. The difference is that threads run in the same memory space, while processes have separate memory. This makes it a bit harder to share objects between processes with multiprocessing. Since threads use the same memory, precautions have to be taken or two threads will write to the same memory at the same time. This is what the global interpreter lock is for."

"I'm iterating over a list of tuples in Python, and am attempting to remove them if they meet certain criteria. ",You can use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the elements you don't want to remove:
"I'm iterating over a list of tuples in Python, and am attempting to remove them if they meet certain criteria. ","The answers suggesting list comprehensions are ALMOST correct -- except that they build a completely new list and then give it the same name the old list as, they do NOT modify the old list in place. That's different from what you'd be doing by selective removal, as in @Lennart's suggestion -- it's faster, but if your list is accessed via multiple references the fact that you're just reseating one of the references and NOT altering the list object itself can lead to subtle, disastrous bugs."

Of course, all of this depends on which browser you are on. All the different browsers expose different things."

"I came across the Python with statement for the first time today.  I've been using Python lightly for several months and didn't even know of its existence!  Given its somewhat obscure status, I thought it would be worth asking:","I believe this has already been answered by other users before me, so I only add it for the sake of completeness: the with statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks in so-called context managers. More details can be found in PEP 343. For instance, the open statement is a context manager in itself, which lets you open a file, keep it open as long as the execution is in the context of the with statement where you used it, and close it as soon as you leave the context, no matter whether you have left it because of an exception or during regular control flow. The with statement can thus be used in ways similar to the RAII pattern in C++: some resource is acquired by the with statement and released when you leave the with context."

Which is better to use for timing in Python? time.clock() or time.time()? Which one provides more accuracy?,"As of 3.3, time.clock() is deprecated, and it's suggested to use time.process_time() or time.perf_counter() instead."
Which is better to use for timing in Python? time.clock() or time.time()? Which one provides more accuracy?,"The short answer is: most of the time time.clock() will be better.
However, if you're timing some hardware (for example some algorithm you put in the GPU), then time.clock() will get rid of this time and time.time() is the only solution left."
