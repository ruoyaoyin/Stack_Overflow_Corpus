"
","<p>In Python, how do you get the last element of a list?</p>","
"
"
",<p><code>some_list[-1]</code> is the shortest and most Pythonic.</p>,"
","<p>In fact, you can do much more with this syntax. The <code>some_list[-n]</code> syntax gets the nth-to-last element. So <code>some_list[-1]</code> gets the last element, <code>some_list[-2]</code> gets the second to last, etc, all the way down to <code>some_list[-len(some_list)]</code>, which gives you the first element.</p>","
",<p>You can also set list elements in this way. For instance:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list[-1] = 5 # Set the last element
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list[-2] = 3 # Set the second to last element
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list
[1, 3, 5]
</code></pre>","
","<p>Note that getting a list item by index will raise an <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>IndexError</code></a> if the expected item doesn't exist. This means that <code>some_list[-1]</code> will raise an exception if <code>some_list</code> is empty, because an empty list can't have a last element.</p>","
"
"
","<p>If your <code>str()</code> or <code>list()</code> objects might end up being empty as so: <code>astr = ''</code> or <code>alist = []</code>, then you might want to use <code>alist[-1:]</code> instead of <code>alist[-1]</code> for object ""sameness"".</p>","
",<p>The significance of this is:</p>,"
","<pre><code>alist = []
alist[-1]   # will generate an IndexError exception whereas 
alist[-1:]  # will return an empty list
astr = ''
astr[-1]    # will generate an IndexError exception whereas
astr[-1:]   # will return an empty str
</code></pre>","
","<p>Where the distinction being made is that returning an empty list object or empty str object is more ""last element""-like then an exception object.</p>","
"
"
",<p>You can also do:</p>,"
","<pre><code>last_elem = alist.pop()
</code></pre>","
",<p>It depends on what you want to do with your list because the <code>pop()</code> method will delete the last element.</p>,"
"
"
",<p>The simplest way to display last element in python is</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list[-1:] # returns indexed value
    [3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[-1]  # returns value
    3
</code></pre>","
",<p>there are many other method to achieve such a goal but these are short and sweet to use.</p>,"

<h2>In Python, how do you get the last element of a list?</h2>
</blockquote>","
","<p>To just get the last element, </p>","
","<ul>
<li>without modifying the list, and </li>
<li>assuming you know the list <em>has</em> a last element (i.e. it is nonempty) </li>
</ul>","
",<p>pass <code>-1</code> to the subscript notation:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three']
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list[-1]
'three'
</code></pre>","
",<h2>Explanation</h2>,"
",<p>Indexes and slices can take negative integers as arguments.</p>,"
","<p>I have modified an example <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">from the documentation</a> to indicate which item in a sequence each index references, in this case, in the string <code>""Python""</code>, <code>-1</code> references the last element, the character, <code>'n'</code>:</p>","
","<pre><code> +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 | P | y | t | h | o | n |
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+
   0   1   2   3   4   5 
  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1

&gt;&gt;&gt; p = 'Python'
&gt;&gt;&gt; p[-1]
'n'
</code></pre>","
",<h2>Assignment via iterable unpacking</h2>,"
","<p>This method may unnecessarily materialize a second list for the purposes of just getting the last element, but for the sake of completeness (and since it supports any iterable - not just lists):</p>","
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; *head, last = a_list
&gt;&gt;&gt; last
'three'
</code></pre>","
","<p>The variable name, head is bound to the unnecessary newly created list:</p>","
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; head
['zero', 'one', 'two']
</code></pre>","
","<p>If you intend to do nothing with that list, this would be more apropos:</p>","
","<pre><code>*_, last = a_list
</code></pre>","
","<p>Or, really, if you know it's a list (or at least accepts subscript notation):</p>","
","<pre><code>last = a_list[-1]
</code></pre>","
",<h2>In a function</h2>,"
",<p>A commenter said:</p>,"
","<blockquote>
<p>I wish Python had a function for first() and last() like Lisp does... it would get rid of a lot of unnecessary lambda functions.</p>
</blockquote>","
",<p>These would be quite simple to define:</p>,"
","<pre><code>def last(a_list):
    return a_list[-1]

def first(a_list):
    return a_list[0]
</code></pre>","
",<p>Or use <code>operator.itemgetter</code>:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import operator
&gt;&gt;&gt; last = operator.itemgetter(-1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; first = operator.itemgetter(0)
</code></pre>","
",<p>In either case:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; last(a_list)
'three'
&gt;&gt;&gt; first(a_list)
'zero'
</code></pre>","
",<h2>Special cases</h2>,"
","<p>If you're doing something more complicated, you may find it more performant to get the last element in slightly different ways.</p>","
","<p>If you're new to programming, you should avoid this section, because it couples otherwise semantically different parts of algorithms together. If you change your algorithm in one place, it may have an unintended impact on another line of code. </p>","
","<p>I try to provide caveats and conditions as completely as I can, but I may have missed something. Please comment if you think I'm leaving a caveat out.</p>","
",<h3>Slicing</h3>,"
",<p>A slice of a list returns a new list - so we can slice from -1 to the end if we are going to want the element in a new list:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a_slice = a_list[-1:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_slice
['three']
</code></pre>","
",<p>This has the upside of not failing if the list is empty:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; empty_list = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; tail = empty_list[-1:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; if tail:
...     do_something(tail)
</code></pre>","
",<p>Whereas attempting to access by index raises an <code>IndexError</code> which would need to be handled:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; empty_list[-1]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>","
","<p>But again, slicing for this purpose should only be done if you need:</p>","
","<ul>
<li>a new list created</li>
<li>and the new list to be empty if the prior list was empty.</li>
</ul>","
",<h3><code>for</code> loops</h3>,"
","<p>As a feature of Python, there is no inner scoping in a <code>for</code> loop.</p>","
","<p>If you're performing a complete iteration over the list already, the last element will still be referenced by the variable name assigned in the loop:</p>","
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def do_something(arg): pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in a_list:
...     do_something(item)
...     
&gt;&gt;&gt; item
'three'
</code></pre>","
","<p>This is not semantically the last thing in the list. This is semantically the last thing that the name, <code>item</code>, was bound to.</p>","
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def do_something(arg): raise Exception
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in a_list:
...     do_something(item)
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in do_something
Exception
&gt;&gt;&gt; item
'zero'
</code></pre>","
",<p>Thus this should only be used to get the last element if you </p>,"
","<ul>
<li>are already looping, and </li>
<li>you know the loop will finish (not break or exit due to errors), otherwise it will point to the last element referenced by the loop.</li>
</ul>","
",<h3>Getting and removing it</h3>,"
",<p>We can also mutate our original list by removing and returning the last element:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list.pop(-1)
'three'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list
['zero', 'one', 'two']
</code></pre>","
",<p>But now the original list is modified. </p>,"
","<p>(<code>-1</code> is actually the default argument, so <code>list.pop</code> can be used without an index argument):</p>","
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list.pop()
'two'
</code></pre>","
",<p>Only do this if</p>,"
","<ul>
<li>you know the list has elements in it, or are prepared to handle the exception if it is empty, and</li>
<li>you do intend to remove the last element from the list, treating it like a stack. </li>
</ul>","
","<p>These are valid use-cases, but not very common.</p>","
",<h3>Saving the rest of the reverse for later:</h3>,"
","<p>I don't know why you'd do it, but for completeness, since <code>reversed</code> returns an <strong><em>iterator</em></strong> (which supports the iterator protocol) you can pass its result to <code>next</code>:</p>","
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; next(reversed([1,2,3]))
3
</code></pre>","
",<p>So it's like doing the reverse of this:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; next(iter([1,2,3]))
1
</code></pre>","
","<p>But I can't think of a good reason to do this, unless you'll need the rest of the reverse iterator later, which would probably look more like this:</p>","
","<pre><code>reverse_iterator = reversed([1,2,3])
last_element = next(reverse_iterator)

use_later = list(reverse_iterator)
</code></pre>","
",<p>and now:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; use_later
[2, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; last_element
3
</code></pre>","
"
"
","<p>To prevent <code>IndexError: list index out of range</code>, use this syntax:</p>","
","<pre><code>mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# With None as default value:
value = mylist and mylist[-1]

# With specified default value (option 1):
value = mylist and mylist[-1] or 'default'

# With specified default value (option 2):
value = mylist[-1] if mylist else 'default'

"

"
"
",<p>Another method:</p>,"
","<pre><code>some_list.reverse() 
some_list[0]
</code></pre>","
"
"
","<p><code>list[-1]</code> will retrieve the last element of the list without changing the list.
<code>list.pop()</code> will retrieve the last element of the list, but it will mutate/change the original list. Usually, mutating the original list is not recommended.</p>","
","<p>Alternatively, if, for some reason, you're looking for something less pythonic, you could use <code>list[len(list)-1]</code>, assuming the list is not empty.</p>","
"
"
","<p>You can also use the code below, if you do not want to get IndexError when the list is empty.</p>","
","<pre><code>next(reversed(some_list), None)
</code></pre>","
"
"
",<p>Here is the solution for your query.</p>,"
","<pre><code>a=[""first"",""second from last"",""last""] # A sample list
print(a[0]) #prints the first item in the list because the index of the list always starts from 0.
print(a[-1]) #prints the last item in the list.
print(a[-2]) #prints the last second item in the list.
</code></pre>","
",<p>Output:</p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; first
&gt;&gt;&gt; last
&gt;&gt;&gt; second from last

"
"
","<p>Ok, but what about common in almost every language way <code>items[len(items) - 1]</code>? This is IMO the easiest way to get last element, because it does not require anything <em>pythonic</em> knowledge.</p>","
"
"
",<h1>Pythonic Way</h1>,"
","<p>So lets consider that we have a list <code>a = [1,2,3,4]</code>, in Python List can be manipulated to give us part of it or a element of it, using the following command one can easily get the last element.</p>","

",<p>Just unpack.</p>,"
"
"
",<p>Accessing the last element from the list in Python:</p>,"
",<p><strong>1: Access the last element with negative indexing -1</strong></p>,"
","<pre><code>&gt;&gt; data = ['s','t','a','c','k','o','v','e','r','f','l','o','w']

'w'

","<pre><code>&gt;&gt; data = ['s','t','a','c','k','o','v','e','r','f','l','o','w']
&gt;&gt; data.pop()
'w'
</code></pre>","
","<p>However, pop method will remove the last element from the list.</p>","
"
"
","<p>To avoid ""IndexError: list index out of range"", you can use this piece of code.</p>","
","<pre><code>list_values = [12, 112, 443]

def getLastElement(lst):

","<pre><code>with FileOpenerCM('file.txt') as fp: # is equal to ""with open('file.txt') as fp:""
      fp.write('dummy text')

","<p>this is a so-called <code>context manager</code>, anything that comes with a <code>with</code> block is a context manager. so let's see how this happens under the hood.</p>","

",<p>the first method <code>__init__</code> is (as you all know) the initialization method of an object. whenever an object is created <code>obj.__init__</code> is definitely called. and that's the place where you put your all the init kinda code.</p>,"
","<p>the second method <code>__enter__</code> is a bit interesting. some of you might not have seen it because it is a specific method for context managers. what it returns is the value to be assigned to the variable after the <code>as</code> keyword. in our case, <code>fp</code>.</p>","
","<p>the last method is the method to run after an error is captured or if the code exits the with block. <code>exc_type</code>, <code>exc_value</code>, <code>exc_traceback</code> variables are the variables that hold the values of the errors that occurred inside with block. for example,</p>","
","<pre><code>exc_type: TypeError
exc_value: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str
exc_traceback: &lt;traceback object at 0x6af8ee10bc4d&gt;
</code></pre>","
","<p>from the first two variables, you can get info enough info about the error. honestly, I don't know the use of the third variable, but for me, the first two are enough. if you want to do more research on context managers surely you can do it and note that writing classes are not the only way to write context managers. with <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">contextlib</a> you can write context managers through functions(actually generators) as well. it's totally up to you to have a look at it. you can surely try
generator functions with contextlib but as I see classes are much cleaner.</p>","

",<h1>What is the <code>SettingWithCopyWarning</code>?</h1>,"
","<p>To know how to deal with this warning, it is important to understand what it means and why it is raised in the first place.</p>","
","<p>When filtering DataFrames, it is possible slice/index a frame to return either a <em>view</em>, or a <em>copy</em>, depending on the internal layout and various implementation details. A ""view"" is, as the term suggests, a view into the original data, so modifying the view may modify the original object. On the other hand, a ""copy"" is a replication of data from the original, and modifying the copy has no effect on the original.</p>","
","<p>As mentioned by other answers, the <code>SettingWithCopyWarning</code> was created to flag ""chained assignment"" operations. Consider <code>df</code> in the setup above. Suppose you would like to select all values in column ""B"" where values in column ""A"" is &gt; 5. Pandas allows you to do this in different ways, some more correct than others. For example,</p>","
","<pre><code>df[df.A &gt; 5]['B']
 
1    3
2    6
Name: B, dtype: int64
</code></pre>","
","<p>And,</p>","
","<pre><code>df.loc[df.A &gt; 5, 'B']

1    3
2    6
Name: B, dtype: int64
</code></pre>","
","<p>These return the same result, so if you are only reading these values, it makes no difference. So, what is the issue? The problem with chained assignment, is that it is generally difficult to predict whether a view or a copy is returned, <strong>so this largely becomes an issue when you are attempting to assign values back.</strong> To build on the earlier example, consider how this code is executed by the interpreter:</p>","
","<pre><code>df.loc[df.A &gt; 5, 'B'] = 4
# becomes
df.__setitem__((df.A &gt; 5, 'B'), 4)
</code></pre>","
","<p>With a single <code>__setitem__</code> call to <code>df</code>. OTOH, consider this code:</p>","
","<pre><code>df[df.A &gt; 5]['B'] = 4
# becomes
df.__getitem__(df.A &gt; 5).__setitem__('B', 4)
</code></pre>","
","<p>Now, depending on whether <code>__getitem__</code> returned a view or a copy, the <code>__setitem__</code> operation <strong>may not work</strong>.</p>","
","<p>In general, you should use <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>loc</code></a> for label-based assignment, and <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>iloc</code></a> for integer/positional based assignment, as the spec guarantees that they always operate on the original. Additionally, for setting a single cell, you should use <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.at.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>at</code></a> and <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.iat.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>iat</code></a>.</p>","
","<p>More can be found in the <a href=""http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a>.</p>","
","<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br/>
All boolean indexing operations done with <code>loc</code> can also be done with <code>iloc</code>. The only difference is that <code>iloc</code> expects either
integers/positions for index or a numpy array of boolean values, and
integer/position indexes for the columns.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code>df.loc[df.A &gt; 5, 'B'] = 4
</code></pre>
<p>Can be written nas</p>
<pre><code>df.iloc[(df.A &gt; 5).values, 1] = 4
</code></pre>
<p>And,</p>
<pre><code>df.loc[1, 'A'] = 100
</code></pre>
<p>Can be written as</p>
<pre><code>df.iloc[1, 0] = 100
</code></pre>
<p>And so on.</p>

",<p>Here I answer the question directly. How to deal with it?</p>,"
","<p>Make a <code>.copy(deep=False)</code> after you slice. See <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.copy.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">pandas.DataFrame.copy</a>.</p>","
","<p>Wait, doesn't a slice return a copy? After all, this is what the warning message is attempting to say? Read the long answer:</p>","
","<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'x':[1,2,3]})
</code></pre>","
",<p>This gives a warning:</p>,"
","<pre><code>df0 = df[df.x&gt;2]
df0['foo'] = 'bar'
</code></pre>","
",<p>This does not:</p>,"
","<pre><code>df1 = df[df.x&gt;2].copy(deep=False)
df1['foo'] = 'bar'
</code></pre>","
","<p>Both <code>df0</code> and <code>df1</code> are <code>DataFrame</code> objects, but something about them is different that enables pandas to print the warning. Let's find out what it is.</p>","
","<pre><code>import inspect
slice= df[df.x&gt;2]
slice_copy = df[df.x&gt;2].copy(deep=False)
inspect.getmembers(slice)
inspect.getmembers(slice_copy)

","<p>Using your diff tool of choice, you will see that beyond a couple of addresses, the only material difference is this:</p>","
","<pre><code>|          | slice   | slice_copy |
| _is_copy | weakref | None       |
</code></pre>","
",<p>The method that decides whether to warn is <code>DataFrame._check_setitem_copy</code> which checks <code>_is_copy</code>. So here you go. Make a <code>copy</code> so that your DataFrame is not <code>_is_copy</code>.</p>,"
","<p>The warning is suggesting to use <code>.loc</code>, but if you use <code>.loc</code> on a frame that <code>_is_copy</code>, you will still get the same warning. Misleading? Yes. Annoying? You bet. Helpful? Potentially, when chained assignment is used. But it cannot correctly detect chain assignment and prints the warning indiscriminately.</p>","
"
"
","<p>This topic is really confusing with Pandas. Luckily, it has a relatively simple solution.</p>","
",<p>The problem is that it is not always clear whether data filtering operations (e.g. loc) return a copy or a view of the DataFrame. Further use of such filtered DataFrame could therefore be confusing.</p>,"
",<p>The simple solution is (unless you need to work with very large sets of data):</p>,"
","<p>Whenever you need to update any values, always make sure that you explicitly copy the DataFrame before the assignment.</p>","
","<pre><code>df  # Some DataFrame
df = df.loc[:, 0:2]  # Some filtering (unsure whether a view or copy is returned)
df = df.copy()  # Ensuring a copy is made
df[df[""Name""] == ""John""] = ""Johny""  # Assignment can be done now (no warning)
</code></pre>","
"
"
",<p>I had been getting this issue with <code>.apply()</code> when assigning a new dataframe from a pre-existing dataframe on which i've used the <code>.query()</code> method. For instance:</p>,"
","<pre><code>prop_df = df.query('column == ""value""')
prop_df['new_column'] = prop_df.apply(function, axis=1)
</code></pre>","
",<p>Would return this error. The fix that seems to resolve the error in this case is by changing this to:</p>,"
","<pre><code>prop_df = df.copy(deep=True)
prop_df = prop_df.query('column == ""value""')
prop_df['new_column'] = prop_df.apply(function, axis=1)
</code></pre>","
","<p>However, this is NOT efficient especially when using large dataframes, due to having to make a new copy.</p>","
","<p>If you're using the <code>.apply()</code> method in generating a new column and its values, a fix that resolves the error and is more efficient is by adding <code>.reset_index(drop=True)</code>:</p>","
","<pre><code>prop_df = df.query('column == ""value""').reset_index(drop=True)
prop_df['new_column'] = prop_df.apply(function, axis=1)

"
"
","<p>To remove any doubt, my solution was to make a deep copy of the slice instead of a regular copy.
This may not be applicable depending on your context (Memory constraints / size of the slice, potential for performance degradation - especially if the copy occurs in a loop like it did for me, etc...)</p>","

","<p>Maybe a clarification for other beginners like me (I come from R which seems to work a bit differently under the hood). The following harmless-looking and functional code kept producing the SettingWithCopy warning, and I couldn't figure out why. I had both read and understood the issued with ""chained indexing"", but my code doesn't contain any:</p>","
","<pre><code>def plot(pdb, df, title, **kw):
    df['target'] = (df['ogg'] + df['ugg']) / 2

","<p>But then, later, much too late, I looked at where the plot() function is called:</p>","
","<pre><code>    df = data[data['anz_emw'] &gt; 0]
    pixbuf = plot(pdb, df, title)

","<p>So ""df"" isn't a data frame but an object that somehow remembers that it was created by indexing a data frame (so is that a view?) which would make the line in plot()</p>","
","<pre><code> df['target'] = ...
</code></pre>","
",<p>equivalent to</p>,"

# Even shallow copy below is enough to not raise the warning, but why is a mystery to me.
b = a.loc[mask]  # .copy(deep=False)

# Raises the `SettingWithCopyWarning`
b[""B""] = b[""B""] * 2

# Does not!
with SuppressPandasWarning():
    b[""B""] = b[""B""] * 2

","<p>Worth noticing is that both approches do not modify <code>a</code>, which is a bit surprising to me, and even a shallow df copy with <code>.copy(deep=False)</code> would prevent this warning to be raised (as far as I understand shallow copy should at least modify <code>a</code> as well, but it doesn't. <code>pandas</code> magic.).</p>","
"
"

","<p>And you do not want to use Jeffs solution because your condition computing <code>df2</code> is to long or for some other reason, then you can use the following:</p>","

","<p>I will give a practical example in scraping web data using python, a lot of the times you will get keys with no values, in those cases you will get errors if you use dictionary['key'], whereas dictionary.get('key', 'return_otherwise') has no problems.</p>","
","<p>Similarly, I would use ''.join(list) as opposed to list[0] if you try to capture a single value from a list.</p>","
",<p>hope it helps.</p>,"
",<p>[Edit] Here is a practical example:</p>,"
","<p>Say, you are calling an API, which returns a JOSN file you need to parse. The first JSON looks like following:</p>","
","<pre><code>{""bids"":{""id"":16210506,""submitdate"":""2011-10-16 15:53:25"",""submitdate_f"":""10\/16\/2011 at 21:53 CEST"",""submitdate_f2"":""p\u0159ed 2 lety"",""submitdate_ts"":1318794805,""users_id"":""2674360"",""project_id"":""1250499""}}
</code></pre>","
",<p>The second JOSN is like this:</p>,"
","<pre><code>{""bids"":{""id"":16210506,""submitdate"":""2011-10-16 15:53:25"",""submitdate_f"":""10\/16\/2011 at 21:53 CEST"",""submitdate_f2"":""p\u0159ed 2 lety"",""users_id"":""2674360"",""project_id"":""1250499""}}
</code></pre>","
","<p>Note that the second JSON is missing the ""submitdate_ts"" key, which is pretty normal in any data structure.</p>","
","<p>So when you try to access the value of that key in a loop, can you call it with the following:</p>","
","<pre><code>for item in API_call:
    submitdate_ts = item[""bids""][""submitdate_ts""]
</code></pre>","
","<p>You could, but it will give you a traceback error for the second JSON line, because the key simply doesn't exist.</p>","
","<p>The appropriate way of coding this, could be the following:</p>","
","<pre><code>for item in API_call:
    submitdate_ts = item.get(""bids"", {'x': None}).get(""submitdate_ts"")
</code></pre>","
",<p>{'x': None} is there to avoid the second level getting an error. Of course you can build in more fault tolerance into the code if you are doing scraping. Like first specifying a if condition</p>,"
"
"
",<p>A gotcha to be aware of when using <code>.get()</code>:</p>,"
","<p>If the dictionary contains the key used in the call to <code>.get()</code> and its value is <code>None</code>, the <code>.get()</code> method will return <code>None</code> even if a default value is supplied.</p>","
","<p>For example, the following returns <code>None</code>, not <code>'alt_value'</code> as may be expected:</p>","
","<pre><code>d = {'key': None}
assert None is d.get('key', 'alt_value')
</code></pre>","
","<p><code>.get()</code>'s second value is only returned if the key supplied is NOT in the dictionary, not if the return value of that call is <code>None</code>.</p>","
"
"
","<p>The purpose is that you can give a default value if the key is not found, which is very useful</p>","

"
","<blockquote>

","<p>Other <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/37968524/6243352"">answers</a> have clearly explained the difference between dict bracket keying and <code>.get</code> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/57582439/6243352"">mentioned a <em>fairly</em> innocuous pitfall</a> when <code>None</code> or the default value is also a valid key.</p>","
","<p>Given this information, it may be tempting conclude that <code>.get</code> is somehow safer and better than bracket indexing and should always be used instead of bracket lookups, as argued in <a href=""https://medium.com/better-programming/stop-using-square-bracket-notation-to-get-a-dictionarys-value-in-python-c617f6ea15a3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Stop Using Square Bracket Notation to Get a Dictionary's Value in Python</em></a>, even in the common case when they expect the lookup to succeed (i.e. never raise a <code>KeyError</code>).</p>","
","<p>The author of the blog post argues that <code>.get</code> ""safeguards your code"":</p>","
","<blockquote>
<p>Notice how trying to reference a term that doesn't exist causes a <code>KeyError</code>. This can cause major headaches, especially when dealing with unpredictable business data.</p>
<p>While we could wrap our statement in a <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> or <code>if</code> statement, this much care for a dictionary term will quickly pile up.</p>
</blockquote>","
","<p>It's true that in the uncommon case for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">null</a> (<code>None</code>)-coalescing or otherwise filling in a missing value to handle unpredictable dynamic data, a judiciously-deployed <code>.get</code> is a useful and Pythonic shorthand tool for ungainly <code>if key in dct:</code> and <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> blocks that only exist to set default values when the key might be missing as part of the behavioral specification for the program.</p>","
","<p>However, replacing <em>all</em> bracket dict lookups, including those that you assert must succeed, with <code>.get</code> is a different matter. This practice effectively downgrades a class of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error_detection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">runtime errors</a> that help reveal bugs into silent illegal state scenarios that tend to be harder to identify and debug.</p>","
","<p>A common mistake among programmers is to think exceptions <em>cause</em> headaches and attempt to suppress them, using techniques like wrapping code in <a href=""https://wiki.c2.com/?PokemonExceptionHandling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>try</code> ... <code>except: pass</code> blocks</a>. They later realize the <em>real</em> headache is never seeing the breach of application logic at the point of failure and deploying a broken application. Better programming practice is to embrace assertions for all program invariants such as keys that must be in a dictionary.</p>","
","<p>The hierarchy of error safety is, broadly:</p>","
","<div class=""s-table-container"">
<table class=""s-table"">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Error category</th>
<th>Relative ease of debugging</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Compile-time error</td>
<td>Easy; go to the line and fix the problem</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Runtime exception</td>
<td>Medium; control needs to flow to the error and it may be due to unanticipated edge cases or hard-to-reproduce state like a race condition between threads, but at least we get a clear error message and stack trace when it does happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Silent logical error</td>
<td>Difficult; we may not even know it exists, and when we do, tracking down state that caused it can be very challenging due to lack of locality and potential for multiple assertion breaches.</td>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>","
","<p>When programming language designers talk about program safety, a major goal is to surface, not suppress, genuine errors by promoting runtime errors to compile-time errors and promote silent logical errors to either runtime exceptions or (ideally) compile-time errors.</p>","
","<p>Python, by design as an interpreted language, relies heavily on runtime exceptions instead of compiler errors. Missing methods or properties, illegal type operations like <code>1 + ""a""</code> and out of bounds or missing indices or keys raise by default.</p>","
","<p>Some languages like JS, Java, Rust and Go use the fallback behavior for their maps by default (and in many cases, don't provide a throw/raise alternative), but Python throws by default, along with other languages like C#. Perl/PHP issue an uninitialized value warning.</p>","
","<p>Indiscriminate application of <code>.get</code> to all dict accesses, even those that aren't expected to fail and have no fallback for dealing with <code>None</code> (or whatever default is used) running amok through the code, pretty much tosses away Python's runtime exception safety net for this class of errors, silencing or adding indirection to potential bugs.</p>","
","<p>Other supporting reasons to prefer bracket lookups (with the occasional, well-placed <code>.get</code> where a default is expected):</p>","
","<ul>
<li>Prefer writing standard, idiomatic code using the tools provided by the language. Python programmers usually (correctly) prefer brackets for the exception safety reasons given above and because it's the default behavior for Python dicts.</li>
<li>Always using <code>.get</code> forfeits intent by making cases when you expect to provide a default <code>None</code> value indistinguishable from a lookup you assert must succeed.</li>
<li>Testing increases in complexity in proportion to the new ""legal"" program paths permitted by <code>.get</code>. Effectively, each lookup is now a branch that can succeed or fail -- both cases must be tested to establish coverage, even if the default path is effectively unreachable by specification (ironically leading to additional <code>if val is not None:</code> or <code>try</code> for all future uses of the retrieved value; unnecessary and confusing for something that should never be <code>None</code> in the first place).</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39582115/python-dictionary-lookup-performance-get-vs-in""><code>.get</code> is a bit slower</a>.</li>
<li><code>.get</code> is harder to type and uglier to read (compare Java's tacked-on-feel <code>ArrayList</code> syntax to native-feel C# <code>Lists</code> or C++ vector code). Minor.</li>
</ul>","
","<p>Some languages like C++ and Ruby offer alternate methods (<code>at</code> and <code>fetch</code>, respectively) to opt-in to throwing an error on a bad access, while C# offers opt-in fallback value <code>TryGetValue</code> similar to Python's <code>get</code>.</p>","
","<p>Since JS, Java, Ruby, Go and Rust bake the fallback approach of <code>.get</code> into all hash lookups by default, it can't be that bad, one might think. It's true that this isn't the largest issue facing language designers and there are plenty of use cases for the no-throw access version, so it's unsurprising that there's no consensus across languages.</p>","
","<p>But as I've argued, Python (along with C#) has done better than these languages by making the assert option the default. It's a loss of safety and expressivity to opt-out of using it to report contract violations at the point of failure by indiscriminately using <code>.get</code> across the board.</p>","

"
",<h2>What is this warning about?</h2>,"
","<p>Modern CPUs provide a lot of low-level instructions, besides the usual arithmetic and logic, known as extensions, e.g. SSE2, SSE4, AVX, etc. From the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>","
","<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advanced Vector Extensions</strong> (<strong>AVX</strong>) are extensions to the x86 instruction
set architecture for microprocessors from Intel and AMD proposed by
Intel in March 2008 and first supported by Intel with the Sandy
Bridge processor shipping in Q1 2011 and later on by AMD with the
Bulldozer processor shipping in Q3 2011. AVX provides new features,
new instructions and a new coding scheme.</p>
</blockquote>","
","<p>In particular, AVX introduces <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply%E2%80%93accumulate_operation#Fused_multiply.E2.80.93add"" rel=""noreferrer"">fused multiply-accumulate</a> (FMA) operations, which speed up linear algebra computation, namely dot-product, matrix multiply, convolution, etc. Almost every machine-learning training involves a great deal of these operations, hence will be faster on a CPU that supports AVX and FMA (up to 300%). The warning states that your CPU does support AVX (hooray!).</p>","
",<p>I'd like to stress here: it's all about <strong>CPU only</strong>.</p>,"
",<h2>Why isn't it used then?</h2>,"
","<p>Because tensorflow default distribution is built <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7778"" rel=""noreferrer"">without CPU extensions</a>, such as SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, FMA, etc. The default builds (ones from <code>pip install tensorflow</code>) are intended to be compatible with as many CPUs as possible. Another argument is that even with these extensions CPU is a lot slower than a GPU, and it's expected for medium- and large-scale machine-learning training to be performed on a GPU.</p>","
",<h2>What should you do?</h2>,"
","<p><strong>If you have a GPU</strong>, you shouldn't care about AVX support, because most expensive ops will be dispatched on a GPU device (unless explicitly set not to). In this case, you can simply ignore this warning by</p>","
","<pre><code># Just disables the warning, doesn't take advantage of AVX/FMA to run faster
import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'
</code></pre>","
","<p>... or by setting <code>export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2</code> if you're on Unix. Tensorflow is working fine anyway, but you won't see these annoying warnings.</p>","
",<hr/>,"
","<p><strong>If you don't have a GPU</strong> and want to utilize CPU as much as possible, <strong>you should build tensorflow from the source optimized for <em>your</em> CPU</strong> with AVX, AVX2, and FMA enabled if your CPU supports them. It's been discussed in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/41293077/712995"">this question</a> and also <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/8037"" rel=""noreferrer"">this GitHub issue</a>. Tensorflow uses an ad-hoc build system called <a href=""https://bazel.build/"" rel=""noreferrer"">bazel</a> and building it is not that trivial, but is certainly doable. After this, not only will the warning disappear, tensorflow performance should also improve.</p>","

",<h1>CPU optimization with GPU</h1>,"
",<p>There are performance gains you can get by installing TensorFlow from the source even if you have a GPU and use it for training and inference.  The reason is that some TF operations only have CPU implementation and cannot run on your GPU.</p>,"
","<p>Also, there are some performance enhancement tips that makes good use of your CPU.  <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_guide"" rel=""noreferrer"">TensorFlow's performance guide</a> recommends the following:</p>","
","<blockquote>
<p>Placing input pipeline operations on the CPU can significantly improve performance. Utilizing the CPU for the input pipeline frees the GPU to focus on training.</p>
</blockquote>","
","<p>For best performance, you should write your code to utilize your CPU and GPU to work in tandem, and not dump it all on your GPU if you have one. 
 Having your TensorFlow binaries optimized for your CPU could pay off hours of saved running time and you have to do it once.</p>","

","<p>If you use the <strong>pip</strong> version of TensorFlow, it means it's already compiled and you are just installing it. Basically you install TensorFlow-GPU, but when you download it from the repository and trying to build it, you should build it with CPU AVX support. If you ignore it, you will get a warning every time when you run on the CPU. You can take a look at those too.</p>","

",<hr/>,"
","<p><em>edit</em>: Though initially I thought these methods were really bad (unless you use many fallbacks, the code may be irrelevant many years from now), it does pose the question ""what is the internet?"". A computer may have many interfaces pointing to many different networks. For a more thorough description of the topic, google for <code>gateways and routes</code>. A computer may be able to access an internal network via an internal gateway, or access the world-wide web via a gateway on for example a router (usually the case). The local IP address that the OP asks about is only well-defined with respect to a single link layer, so you have to specify that (""is it the network card, or the ethernet cable, which we're talking about?""). There may be multiple non-unique answers to this question as posed. However the global IP address on the world-wide web is probably well-defined (in the absence of massive network fragmentation): probably the return path via the gateway which can access the TLDs.</p>","

"
",<p>I've tried to find a comprehensive guide on whether it is best to use <code>import module</code> or <code>from module import</code>. I've just started with Python and I'm trying to start off with best practices in mind.</p>,"
","<p>Basically, I was hoping if anyone could share their experiences, what preferences other developers have and what's the best way to avoid any <em>gotchas</em> down the road?</p>","
"
"
",<p>The difference between <code>import module</code> and <code>from module import foo</code> is mainly subjective.  Pick the one you like best and be consistent in your use of it.  Here are some points to help you decide.</p>,"
",<p><code>import module</code></p>,"
","<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Less maintenance of your <code>import</code> statements. Don't need to add any additional imports to start using another item from the module</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Typing <code>module.foo</code> in your code can be tedious and redundant (tedium can be minimized by using <code>import module as mo</code> then typing <code>mo.foo</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>","
",<p><code>from module import foo</code></p>,"
","<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Less typing to use <code>foo</code></li>
<li>More control over which items of a module can be accessed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To use a new item from the module you have to update your <code>import</code> statement</li>
<li>You lose context about <code>foo</code>. For example, it's less clear what <code>ceil()</code> does compared to <code>math.ceil()</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>","
","<p>Either method is acceptable, but <strong>don't</strong> use <code>from module import *</code>.  </p>","
","<p>For any reasonable large set of code, if you <code>import *</code> you will likely be cementing it into the module, unable to be removed.  This is because it is difficult to determine what items used in the code are coming from 'module', making it easy to get to the point where you think you don't use the <code>import</code> any more but it's extremely difficult to be sure.</p>","
"
"
","<p>There's another detail here, not mentioned, related to writing to a module. Granted this may not be very common, but I've needed it from time to time.</p>","
","<p>Due to the way references and name binding works in Python, if you want to update some symbol in a module, say foo.bar, from outside that module, and have other importing code ""see"" that change, you have to import foo a certain way. For example:</p>","
",<p>module foo:</p>,"
","<pre><code>bar = ""apples""
</code></pre>","
",<p>module a:</p>,"
","<pre><code>import foo
foo.bar = ""oranges""   # update bar inside foo module object
</code></pre>","
",<p>module b:</p>,"
","<pre><code>import foo           
print foo.bar        # if executed after a's ""foo.bar"" assignment, will print ""oranges""
</code></pre>","
","<p>However, if you import symbol names instead of module names, this will not work.</p>","
","<p>For example, if I do this in module a:</p>","
","<pre><code>from foo import bar
bar = ""oranges""
</code></pre>","
","<p>No code outside of <code>a</code> will see <code>bar</code> as ""oranges"" because my setting of <code>bar</code> merely affected the name ""bar"" inside module <code>a</code>, it did not ""reach into"" the <code>foo</code> module object and update its <code>bar</code>.</p>","
"
"
","<p>Even though many people already explained about <code>import</code> vs <code>import from</code>, I want to try to explain a bit more about what happens under the hood, and where all the places it changes are.</p>","
",<hr/>,"

",<p>Both ways are supported for a reason: there are times when one is more appropriate than the other.</p>,"
","<ul>

</ul>","
","<p>Which to use depends on which makes the code clear and readable, and has more than a little to do with personal preference.

"
"
",<p>I personally always use </p>,"
","<pre><code>from package.subpackage.subsubpackage import module

",<p>and then access everything as</p>,"
","<pre><code>module.function

</code></pre>","
","<p>etc. The reason is that at the same time you have short invocation, and you clearly define the module namespace of each routine, something that is very useful if you have to search for usage of a given module in your source.</p>","
","<p>Needless to say, do not use the import *, because it pollutes your namespace and it does not tell you where a given function comes from (from which module)</p>","
","<p>Of course, you can run in trouble if you have the same module name for two different modules in two different packages, like</p>","
","<pre><code>from package1.subpackage import module

",<p>Is best when you will use many functions from the module.</p>,"
","<pre><code>from module import function

",<p>Is best when you want to avoid polluting the global namespace with all the functions and types from a module when you only need <code>function</code>.</p>,"

"
",<p>I've just discovered one more subtle difference between these two methods.</p>,"
",<p>If module <code>foo</code> uses a following import:</p>,"

",<p>Note that when using </p>,"
","<pre><code>from package import item
</code></pre>","
","<p>the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in the package, like a function, class or variable.

If it fails to find it, an ImportError exception is raised.</p>","
","<p>Contrarily, when using syntax like </p>","
","<pre><code>import item.subitem.subsubitem

"
","<p>Since I am also a beginner, I will be trying to explain this in a simple way:
In Python, we have three types of <code>import</code> statements which are:</p>","
",<p><strong>1. Generic imports:</strong></p>,"
","<pre><code>import math
</code></pre>","
","<p><em>this type of import is my personal favorite, the only downside to this import technique is that if you need use any module's function you must use the following syntax:</em></p>","
","<pre><code>math.sqrt(4)
</code></pre>","
","<p><em>of course, it increases the typing effort but as a beginner, it will help you to keep track of module and function associated with it, (a good text editor will reduce the typing effort significantly and is recommended).</em></p>","
",<p><em><strong>Typing effort can be further reduced by using this import statement:</strong></em></p>,"
","<pre><code>import math as m
</code></pre>","
","<p><em>now, instead of using <code>math.sqrt()</code> you can use <code>m.sqrt()</code>.</em></p>","
",<p><strong>2. Function imports:</strong></p>,"
","<pre><code>from math import sqrt
</code></pre>","
","<p><em>this type of import is best suited if your code only needs to access single or few functions from the module, but for using any new item from the module you have to update import statement.</em></p>","
",<p><strong>3. Universal imports:</strong></p>,"
","<pre><code>from math import * 
</code></pre>","
","<p><em>Although it reduces typing effort significantly but is not recommended because it will fill your code with various functions from the module and their name could conflict with the name of user-defined functions.</em>
<strong>example:</strong></p>","
","<h3>If you have a function of your very own named sqrt and you import math, your function is safe: there is your sqrt and there is math.sqrt.

","<p>My own answer to this depends mostly on first, how many different modules I'll be using.  If i'm only going to use one or two, I'll often use <strong><code>from</code></strong> ... <strong><code>import</code></strong> since it makes for fewer keystrokes in the rest of the file, but if I'm going to make use of many different modules, I prefer just <strong><code>import</code></strong> because that means that each module reference is self-documenting.  I can see where each symbol comes from without having to hunt around.</p>","

","<p>There are some builtin modules that contain mostly bare functions (<a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">base64</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">math</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">os</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shutil</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sys</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">time</a>, ...) and it is definitely a good practice to have these bare functions <em>bound</em> to some namespace and thus improve the readability of your code.

","<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>copysign(foo, bar)

On the other hand there are some modules that contain mostly classes (<a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">configparser</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">datetime</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tempfile</a>, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">zipfile</a>, ...) and many of them make their class names self-explanatory enough:</p>","

",<p>Then restart iPython/Jupyter notebooks. Note that this will affect all notebooks.</p>,"

",<p>If that file is <code>custom.css</code> then add a cell containing:</p>,"
","<pre><code>from IPython.core.display import HTML

    styles = open(""custom.css"", ""r"").read()
    return HTML(styles)

","<p>This will apply all the stylings, and, in particular, change the cell width.</p>","
"

","<p>(As of 2018, I would advise trying out JupyterHub/JupyterLab. It uses the full width of the monitor. If this is not an option, maybe since you are using one of the cloud-based Jupyter-as-a-service providers, keep reading)</p>","
","<p>(Stylish is accused of stealing user data, I have moved on to using Stylus plugin instead)</p>","
","<p>I recommend using <a href=""https://userstyles.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stylish Browser Plugin</a>. This way you can override css for all notebooks, without adding any code to notebooks. 
We don't like to change configuration in .ipython/profile_default, since  we are running a shared Jupyter server for the whole team and width is a user preference.</p>","
","<p>I made a  style specifically for vertically-oriented high-res screens, that makes cells wider and adds a bit of empty-space in the bottom, so you can position the last cell in the centre of the screen.
<a href=""https://userstyles.org/styles/131230/jupyter-wide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://userstyles.org/styles/131230/jupyter-wide</a>
You can, of course, modify my css to your liking, if you have a different layout, or you don't want extra empty-space in the end.</p>","
","<p>Last but not least, Stylish is a great tool to have in your toolset, since you can easily customise other sites/tools to your liking (e.g. Jira, Podio, Slack, etc.)</p>","
","<pre><code>@media (min-width: 1140px) {

","<p>For Chrome users, I recommend <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stylebot</a>, which will let you override any CSS on any page, also let you search and install other share custom CSS.

Just copy and paste, or just your editor:</p>","
","<pre><code>#notebook-container.container {
    width: 90%;
}
</code></pre>","
","<p>Change the width as you like, I find 90% looks nicer than 100%. But it is totally up to your eye.</p>","
"
"
",<p>I made some modification to @jvd10's solution. The '!important' seems too strong that the container doesn't adapt well when TOC sidebar is displayed. I removed it and added 'min-width' to limit the minimal width.</p>,"
",<p>Here is my .juyputer/custom/custom.css:</p>,"
","<pre><code>/* Make the notebook cells take almost all available width and limit minimal width to 1110px */
.container {

/* Prevent the edit cell highlight box from getting clipped;
 * important so that it also works when cell is in edit mode*/
div.cell.selected {
    border-left-width: 1px;
}
</code></pre>","
"
"
","<p>Note that if you do this the old way, you'll now get a deprecation warning. This uses the newer submodule naming:</p>","
","<pre><code>from IPython.display import HTML

HTML(""&lt;style&gt;.container { width:100% !important; }&lt;/style&gt;"")

"
"
","<p>I tried everything and nothing worked for me, I ended up using displaying my data frame as HTML as follows</p>","
","<pre><code>from IPython.display import HTML    
HTML (pd.to_html())
</code></pre>","
"
"
","<p>For Firefox/Chrome users, a nice way to achieve 100% width is to use a custom <a href=""https://www.tampermonkey.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TamperMonkey</a> script.</p>","

<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p><strong><code>print</code></strong> was a <strong>statement</strong> in <strong>2.x</strong>, but it's a <strong>function</strong> in <strong>3.x</strong>. Now, there are a number of good reasons for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>With function format of Python 3.x, more flexibility comes when printing multiple items with comma separated.</li>
<li>You can't use argument splatting with a statement. In 3.x if you have a list of items that you want to print with a separator, you can do this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; items = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(*items, sep='+')
foo+bar+baz
</code></pre>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>You can't override a statement. If you want to change the behavior of print, you can do that when it's a function but not when it's a statement.</li>
</ol>
</hr>"
"
","<p>If your code should work in both Python 2 and 3, you can achieve this by loading this at the beginning of your program:</p>","
","<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function   # If code has to work in Python 2 and 3!
</code></pre>","
",<p>Then you can print in the Python 3 way:</p>,"
","<pre><code>print(""python"")
</code></pre>","
",<p>If you want to print something without creating a new line - you can do this:</p>,"
","<pre><code>for number in range(0, 10):
    print(number, end=', ')
</code></pre>","
"
"
","<p>In Python 3, you can only print as:</p>","
","<pre><code>print(""STRING"")
</code></pre>","
","<p>But in Python 2, the parentheses are not necessary.</p>","
"
"
","<p>I could also just add that I knew everything about the syntax change between <code>Python2.7</code> and <code>Python3</code>, and my code was correctly written as <code>print(""string"")</code> and even 
<code>print(f""string"")</code>... </p>","
",<p>But after some time of debugging I realized that my bash script was calling python like: </p>,"
","<blockquote>
<p>python file_name.py</p>
</blockquote>","
",<p>which had the effect of calling my python script by default using <code>python2.7</code> which gave the error. So I changed my bash script to:</p>,"
","<blockquote>
<p>python3 file_name.py</p>
</blockquote>","
",<p>which of coarse uses python3 to run the script which fixed the error.</p>,"
"
"
","<p>Outside of the direct answers here, one should note the other key difference between python 2 and 3.

","<p>As far as I can tell, you are beginning to learn the python language. You should consider the aforementioned articles before you continue down the python 3 route.

","<p>I found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1186789/what-is-the-best-way-to-call-a-python-script-from-another-python-script"">Stack Overflow question 1186789</a> which is a similar question, but ars's answer calls a function, where as I want to run the whole script, not just a function, and balpha's answer calls the script but with no arguments. I changed this to something like the below as a test:</p>","
","<pre><code>execfile(""script2.py 1"")
</code></pre>","
","<p>But it is not accepting variables properly. When I print out the <code>sys.argv</code> in script2.py it is the original command call to first script ""['C:\script1.py'].</p>","
",<p>I don't really want to change the original script (i.e. script2.py in my example) since I don't own it.</p>,"
",<p>I figure there must be a way to do this; I am just confused how you do it.</p>,"
"
"
","<p>Try using <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.system""><code>os.system</code></a>:</p>","
","<pre><code>os.system(""script2.py 1"")
</code></pre>","
",<p><code>execfile</code> is different because it is designed to run a sequence of Python statements in the <em>current</em> execution context. That's why <code>sys.argv</code> didn't change for you.</p>,"
"
"
","<p>This is inherently the wrong thing to do. If you are running a Python script from another Python script, you should communicate through Python instead of through the OS:</p>","
","<pre><code>import script1
</code></pre>","
","<p>In an ideal world, you will be able to call a function inside <code>script1</code> directly:</p>","
","<pre><code>for i in range(whatever):
    script1.some_function(i)
</code></pre>","
","<p>If necessary, you can hack <code>sys.argv</code>. There's a neat way of doing this using a context manager to ensure that you don't make any permanent changes.</p>","
","<pre><code>import contextlib
@contextlib.contextmanager
def redirect_argv(num):
    sys._argv = sys.argv[:]
    sys.argv=[str(num)]
    yield
    sys.argv = sys._argv

with redirect_argv(1):
    print(sys.argv)
</code></pre>","
",<p>I think this is preferable to passing all your data to the OS and back; that's just silly.</p>,"
"
"
","<p>Ideally, the Python script you want to run will be set up with code like this near the end:</p>","
","<pre><code>def main(arg1, arg2, etc):
    # do whatever the script does


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3])
</code></pre>","
","<p>In other words, <em>if</em> the module is called from the command line, it parses the command line options and then calls another function, <code>main()</code>, to do the actual work. (The actual arguments will vary, and the parsing may be more involved.)</p>","
","<p>If you want to call such a script from another Python script, however, you can simply <code>import</code> it and call <code>modulename.main()</code> directly, rather than going through the operating system.</p>","
","<p><code>os.system</code> will work, but it is the roundabout (read ""slow"") way to do it, as you are starting a whole new Python interpreter process each time for no raisin.</p>","
"
"
",<p>I think the good practice may be something like this; </p>,"
","<pre><code>import subprocess
cmd = 'python script.py'

p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
out, err = p.communicate() 
result = out.split('\n')
for lin in result:
    if not lin.startswith('#'):
        print(lin)
</code></pre>","
","<p>according to documentation 
The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. This module intends to replace several older modules and functions:</p>","
","<pre><code>os.system
os.spawn*
os.popen*
popen2.*
commands.*
</code></pre>","
","<p>Use communicate() rather than .stdin.write, .stdout.read or .stderr.read to avoid deadlocks due to any of the other OS pipe buffers filling up and blocking the child process.

",<p>I want to perform my own complex operations on financial data in dataframes in a sequential manner.</p>,"
","<p>For example I am using the following MSFT CSV file taken from <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=MSFT"">Yahoo Finance</a>:</p>","

",<p>I then do the following:</p>,"
","<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

","<p>Is that the most efficient way? Given the focus on speed in pandas, I would assume there must be some special function to iterate through the  values in a manner that one also retrieves the index (possibly through a generator to be memory efficient)? <code>df.iteritems</code> unfortunately only iterates column by column.</p>","
"
"
",<p>The newest versions of pandas now include a built-in function for iterating over rows. </p>,"
","<pre><code>for index, row in df.iterrows():

    # do some logic here
</code></pre>","
","<p>Or, if you want it faster use <code>itertuples()</code></p>","
","<p>But, unutbu's suggestion to use numpy functions to avoid iterating over rows will produce the fastest code. </p>","
"
"
","<p>Pandas is based on NumPy arrays.
The key to speed with NumPy arrays is to perform your operations on the whole array at once, never row-by-row or item-by-item.</p>","
","<p>For example, if <code>close</code> is a 1-d array, and you want the day-over-day percent change,</p>","
","<pre><code>pct_change = close[1:]/close[:-1]
</code></pre>","
","<p>This computes the entire array of percent changes as one statement, instead of </p>","
","<pre><code>pct_change = []
for row in close:
    pct_change.append(...)
</code></pre>","
","<p>So try to avoid the Python loop <code>for i, row in enumerate(...)</code> entirely, and
think about how to perform your calculations with operations on the entire array (or dataframe) as a whole, rather than row-by-row.</p>","
"
"
","<p>Like what has been mentioned before, pandas object is most efficient when process the whole array at once. However for those who really need to loop through a pandas DataFrame to perform something, like me, I found at least three ways to do it.

","<p>I believe the most simple and efficient way to loop through DataFrames is using numpy and numba.  In that case, looping can be approximately as fast as vectorized operations in many cases.  If numba is not an option, plain numpy is likely to be the next best option.  As has been noted many times, your default should be vectorization, but this answer merely considers efficient looping, given the decision to loop, for whatever reason.</p>","
","<p>For a test case, let's use the example from @DSM's answer of calculating a percentage change.  This is a very simple situation and as a practical matter you would not write a loop to calculate it, but as such it provides a reasonable baseline for timing vectorized approaches vs loops.</p>","
","<p>Let's set up the 4 approaches with a small DataFrame, and we'll time them on a larger dataset below.</p>","

",<p>Other details:</p>,"
","<ul>
<li>Not shown are various options like iterrows, itertuples, etc. which are orders of magnitude slower and really should never be used.</li>
<li>The timings here are fairly typical: numpy is faster than pandas and vectorized is faster than loops, but adding numba to numpy will often speed numpy up dramatically.</li>
<li>Everything except the pandas option requires converting the DataFrame column to a numpy array.  That conversion is included in the timings.</li>
<li>The time to define/compile the numpy/numba functions was not included in the timings, but would generally be a negligible component of the timing for any large dataframe.</li>
