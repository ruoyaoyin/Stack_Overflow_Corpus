"In Python, what are metaclasses and what do we use them for?","Before understanding metaclasses, you need to master classes in Python. And Python has a very peculiar idea of what classes are, borrowed from the Smalltalk language."
"In Python, what are metaclasses and what do we use them for?",A metaclass is the class of a class. A class defines how an instance of the class (i.e. an object) behaves while a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass.

"The Python documentation seems unclear about whether parameters are passed by reference or value, and the following code produces the unchanged value 'Original'",Arguments are passed by assignment. The rationale behind this is twofold:
"The Python documentation seems unclear about whether parameters are passed by reference or value, and the following code produces the unchanged value 'Original'","The problem comes from a misunderstanding of what variables are in Python.

Why is this, and how can I clone or copy the list to prevent it?","With new_list = my_list, you don't actually have two lists.

"I'm trying to understand the use of super(). From the looks of it, both child classes can be created, just fine. ","super() lets you avoid referring to the base class explicitly, which can be nice.

"I'm trying to understand the use of super(). From the looks of it, both child classes can be created, just fine.

"In the following method definitions, what does the * and ** do for param2?",The *args and **kwargs is a common idiom to allow arbitrary number of arguments to functions as described in the section more on defining functions in the Python documentation.
"In the following method definitions, what does the * and ** do for param2?","It's also worth noting that you can use * and ** when calling functions as well.

Is there any benefit in using compile for regular expressions in Python?,"I've had a lot of experience running a compiled regex 1000s of times versus compiling on-the-fly, and have not noticed any perceivable difference.

Is there a way to make .readline non-blocking or to check if there is data on the stream before I invoke .readline? I'd like this to be portable or at least work under Windows and Linux.,"I have often had a similar problem; Python programs I write frequently need to have the ability to execute some primary functionality while simultaneously accepting user input from the command line (stdin). Simply putting the user input handling functionality in another thread doesn't solve the problem because readline() blocks and has no timeout. If the primary functionality is complete and there is no longer any need to wait for further user input I typically want my program to exit, but it can't because readline() is still blocking in the other thread waiting for a line. A solution I have found to this problem is to make stdin a non-blocking file using the fcntl module:"

What the difference is between flush() and commit() in SQLAlchemy?,"A Session object is basically an ongoing transaction of changes to a database (update, insert, delete). These operations aren't persisted to the database until they are committed (if your program aborts for some reason in mid-session transaction, any uncommitted changes within are lost)."
What the difference is between flush() and commit() in SQLAlchemy?,This does not strictly answer the original question but some people have mentioned that with session.autoflush = True you don't have to use session.flush()... And this is not always true.
I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around PEP 380.,"Let's get one thing out of the way first. The explanation that yield from g is equivalent to for v in g: yield v does not even begin to do justice to what yield from is all about. Because, let's face it, if all yield from does is expand the for loop, then it does not warrant adding yield from to the language and preclude a whole bunch of new features from being implemented in Python 2.x."

How do I learn where the source file for a given Python module is installed? Is the method different on Windows than on Linux?,"For a pure python module you can find the source by looking at themodule.__file__.

How do I learn where the source file for a given Python module is installed? Is the method different on Windows than on Linux?,Running python -v from the command line should tell you what is being imported and from where.  This works for me on Windows and Mac OS X.
Is there a performance or code maintenance issue with using assert as part of the standard code instead of using it just for debugging purposes?,Asserts should be used to test conditions that should never happen.  The purpose is to crash early in the case of a corrupt program state.
