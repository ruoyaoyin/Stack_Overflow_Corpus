## Annotation Goal

The goal for our annotation is to provide a corpus that allows the user to classify question-answer pairs with respect to keywords related to those pairs. Since the annotated keywords should be generated from the text of the question-answer pairs, there is no pre-determined set of keyword labels, and we rely on inter-annotator agreement to finalize on the total set of keywords. 

## Annotation Guideline

To annotate with respect to our goal, each annotator is required to read each question and answer pair thoroughly and extract the key phrases that summarizes the text from the question and answer seperately. Since we are dealing with answering to programming questions, the annotator is also required to recognize general terms associated with the coding techniques used in the answers. For example, if the answer involves utilizing a certain library, it should be annotated as 'external library' even if the phrase might not explicitly occur in the answer. Then, the annotator needs to systhesize the two set of key phrases and find the optimal ones from all the overlappings. Visualized examples can be found in the table below:

|   I have two Python dictionaries, and I want to write a single expression that returns these two dictionaries, merged (i.e. taking the union).  The update() method would be what I need, if it returned its result instead of modifying a dictionary in-place.  |   For dictionaries x and y, z becomes a shallowly-merged dictionary with values from y replacing those from x.                                                                                      |   dictionary, shallow-merging    |   |   |
