When you import a module it doesn't just 'recognize' it and wait for further instructions - it actually runs all the executable operations contained within the script. So, putting the meat of your script into the <code>main()</code> function effectively quarantines it, putting it in isolation so that it won't immediately run when imported by another script.</p>, '\\n', <p>Again, there will be exceptions, but common practice is that <code>main()</code> doesn't usually get called externally. So you may be wondering one more thing: if we're not calling <code>main()</code>, why are we calling the script at all? It's because many people structure their scripts with standalone functions that are built to be run independent of the rest of the code in the file. They're then later called somewhere else in the body of the script. Which brings me to this:</p>, '\\n', <blockquote>\n",

      "</blockquote>, '\\n', <p>Yes, that's right. These separate functions <strong>can</strong> be called from an in-line script that's not contained inside a <code>main()</code> function. If you're accustomed (as I am, in my early learning stages of programming) to building in-line scripts that do exactly what you need, and you'll try to figure it out again if you ever need that operation again ... well, you're not used to this kind of internal structure to your code, because it's more complicated to build and it's not as intuitive to read.</p>, '\\n', <p>But that's a script that probably can't have its functions called externally, because if it did it would immediately start calculating and assigning variables. And chances are if you're trying to re-use a function, your new script is related closely enough to the old one that there will be conflicting variables.</p>, '\\n', <p>In splitting out independent functions, you gain the ability to re-use your previous work by calling them into another script. For example, \"example.py\" might import \"xy.py\" and call <code>x()</code>, making use of the 'x' function from \"xy.py\".

You want <code>main()</code> to run if your file was directly invoked (that's the <code>__name__ == \"__main__\"</code> case), but if your code was imported then the importer has to enter your code from the true main module to avoid import lock problems.</p>, '\\n', <p>A side-effect is that you automatically sign on to a methodology that supports multiple entry points. You can run your program using <code>main()</code> as the entry point, <em>but you don't have to</em>. While <code>setup.py</code> expects <code>main()</code>, other tools use alternate entry points. For example, to run your file as a <code>gunicorn</code> process, you define an <code>app()</code> function instead of a <code>main()</code>. Just as with <code>setup.py</code>, <code>gunicorn</code> imports your code so you don't want it do do anything while it's being imported (because of the import lock issue).</p>, '\\n']\n",
