## Team Procedures
1.	Day, time, and place for regular team meeting:
* One group meeting will be held on Monday, 2:30 pm at ORCH 3018, UBC campus or over Zoom/Slack.
* The meeting with the instructor will be held on Friday (Feb 18), 10:30 am and Monday (after Feb 28) around 2 pm.
* The other group meeting will be held on Thursday, after 4:00 pm at ORCH 3018, UBC campus or over Zoom/Slack.

2.	Methods of communication (make decisions, and to share commonly used documents)
* Our main method of distance communication is through Slack to inform each other of team meetings, announcement, updates, reminders, or problems.
* Face-to-face group meeting to discuss the topic and brainstorm is preferred, especially when discussing ideas. It’s more effective than discussing online, where a team member can express his opinion easily and receive feedback in a faster and smoother way. We can also ensure everyone is on the same page and that the message is received as intended. However, Zoom or Slack is also acceptable.
* Document sharing should be completed through github group repo or Slack group chat.


## Team Participation 
1.	Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:
* Face to face meeting is essential when working on any projects. It acts as a pushing factor in making everyone working harder and avoid slacking off. We will also set a deadline for each task, where the assigned person can ask for help if he has difficulties before it is too late. As a result, it is important to know each one’s skills before starting the project. 
* Tasks and work distribution will be managed as entire unit and separated equally. Meanwhile, we also will take every member’s strength into consideration when split the work. 
* If a member feels overwhelmed with work or encounter problems, team members will reach out to help and come up with a solution. 

2.	Strategies for task maintenance:
* When brainstorming, all group members are encouraged to participate and to discuss. 
* We do not have formal team leader. Actually, all members share responsibilities, benefit from the outcomes and hold ourselves and each other responsible for deliverables during the project.

 
## Team Decision-making:
1.	Decisions will be made and discussed as a team 
2.	Majority vote can be used in the team if the team cannot achieve an agreement.  
3.	Once decided, all members should remain committed to any decision or tasks since all members have agreed to follow the decision. 

Team Work Expectation 
1.	Individual attendance and participation at all team meetings will be required for all members 
2.	Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines: 
* Responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines will be required for all members. 
* In team meeting, members will check and confirm each other’s progress, verify that it is being completed on time, or work together to tackle issues certain members encounter.
